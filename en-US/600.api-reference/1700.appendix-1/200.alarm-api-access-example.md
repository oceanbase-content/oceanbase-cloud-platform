View alerts through APIs
================================

This topic describes how to view OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) alerts on your alert platform.

Background
-------------------------

You must call APIs to query OCP alerts on your alert platform. For more information, see [Query the alert event list](../9.alert/1.alert-events/1.query-the-alert-event-list.md).

Scenario 1: View real-time alerts
--------------------------------

The following sample code shows how to view real-time OCP alerts. You can call the corresponding API on a regular basis to query the alert event list and learn of the alert objects in real time.

### Sample code

```javascript
curl 'http://OCP-IP:8080/api/v2/alarm/alarms?isSubscribedByMe=false&status=Active&page=1&size=10' \
--user username:password \
--compressed \
--insecure
```

The `data.page.totalPages` field indicates the total pages of real-time alerts. You can view the alerts on a specific page. For example, you can set the `page` field to 2 and view the alerts on Page 2:

```javascript
curl 'http://OCP-IP:8080/api/v2/alarm/alarms?isSubscribedByMe=false&status=Active&page=2&size=10' \
--user username:password \
--compressed \
--insecure
```

Key fields

| Field | Description |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| alarmType | The name of the alert rule.  |
| activeAt | The time when the alert was triggered, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). You need to convert it to the local time before use.  |
| updatedAt | The time when the alert was updated, in GMT. You need to convert it to the local time before use.  |
| target | The alert object, such as a tenant of a cluster.  |
| description | The description of the alert.  |
| summary | The summary of the alert.  |
| level | The alert level.  |
| labels | Other information, such as the cluster (obregion or ob_cluster in previous versions), tenant (tenant_name), or host IP address (svr_ip). A `labels` field suffixed with `_1`, `_2`, or `_3` is in non-standard format. We recommend that you use this format only when necessary. This field is not used in later versions of OCP.  For more information about supported labels, see [Examples of alert channel configuration](../../4.user-guide-2/13.appendix-2/9.configuration-examples-1.md). |

Scenario 2: Connect to your alert platform
----------------------------------

Based on the sample code in Scenario 1, you can call the corresponding API on a regular basis to query the alert event list and update the status of the alert object (target).

The following information is updated:

* The last alert time. You can calculate the duration of an alert based on the time when the alert was triggered.

* The alert status. If the alert of a target is not returned for each batch, the alert is set to the cleared state. When you query multiple pages, alerts on these pages are returned in a batch.

* The number of alerts of each alert level in the Alerting state in real time.

Scenario 3: Verify alert availability
---------------------------------

To prevent hidden dangers due to alert unavailability, you can trigger an alert on a regular basis based on the following sample code to verify the alert trace availability.

### Sample code

1. You can trigger a log alert. For example, you can write the following ERROR log to the runtime log of an OBServer:

   ```javascript
   echo '[2035-01-02 15:04:05.666666] ERROR [CLOG] update_free_quota (ob_log_file_pool.cpp:413) [1994][2072][Y0-0000000000000000] [lt=19] [dc=0] test ob error for ocp alarm, just ignore. ret=-999999' >> /home/admin/oceanbase/log/observer.log.wf
   ```

2. Run the following command to call the API and verify the log alert:

3. Set the keyword in the request to the log content.

4. If the alert is displayed on your alert platform, the alert trace is working.
