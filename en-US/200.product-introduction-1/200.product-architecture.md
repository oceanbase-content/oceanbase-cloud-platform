# System architecture

This topic describes the system architecture of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

The figure below shows the system architecture of OCP.

In the figure:

* OCP-Server and OCP-Agent are OCP components.

* MetaDB, MonitorDB, and OBProxy are databases or services that OCP depends on.

* The alert channel interconnects with external alert platforms. OCP pushes alerts to external alert platforms through the alert channel based on client calls.

> **Notes**
>
> OCP and its managed targets must be deployed in interconnected networks. The targets may include OceanBase clusters, OBProxy clusters, and backup and recovery clusters.

The following table describes the modules in the system architecture.

| **Module** | **Description** |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OCP-Server |<ul><li>It is the OCP-Server service program written in Java.</li><li>It can be deployed on a single node or on multiple nodes for high availability. When OCP-Server is deployed on multiple nodes, load balancing must also be deployed.</li>   <li>We recommend that you configure an IP address whitelist when OCP-Server accesses the OceanBase cluster. This is to prevent the account that is used by OCP-Server for accessing the OceanBase cluster from being leaked.</li><li>When OCP-Server accesses the hosts of the managed targets, we recommend that you set up a firewall to control access.</li></ul>  |
| MetaDB | MetaDB stores metadata that OCP-Server depends on. In the production environment, we recommend that you deploy MetaDB as a multi-replica OceanBase database.  |
| MonitorDB | MonitorDB stores monitoring data and performance data collected by OCP. Such data includes performance metrics and the statistical and diagnostic information of hosts, clusters, tenants, sessions, and SQL statements.  |
| OBProxy | Both MetaDB and MonitorDB are deployed as OceanBase clusters. OCP-Server accesses MetaDB and MonitorDB through OBProxy.  |
| OCP console | The OCP administrator accesses the OCP console through a browser.  |
| Alert channel | <ul><li>Through the alert channel, OCP-Server pushes the alert events that are generated when it monitors and inspects the targets under OCP management.</li>    <li>OCP supports pushing alert events via HTTP and customized scripts. After OCP is deployed, the administrator can manage the alert channel in the OCP console.</li></ul>  |
| OCP-Agent | To manage targets, OCP-Agent needs to be installed on the hosts of managed targets. OCP-Agent is used to collect monitoring data and run O&M commands. The host management module of OCP-Server automatically deploys and maintains OCP-Agent.  |
