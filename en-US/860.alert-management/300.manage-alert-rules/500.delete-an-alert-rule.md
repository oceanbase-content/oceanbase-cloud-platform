# Delete an alert rule

A system administrator and OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) alert administrator can delete alert rules. System built-in alert rules cannot be deleted.

* The logged-on user has the system administrator or OCP alert administrator role.

* You have created an alert rule. For more information, see [Create an alert rule](../300.manage-alert-rules/100.create-an-alert-rule.md). You can delete only custom alert rules.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alert** > **Alerts**.

3. On the **Alert Rules** tab, find the specified alert rule.

4. In the **Actions** column of the alert rule, click the More icon (**...**) and select **Delete**.
