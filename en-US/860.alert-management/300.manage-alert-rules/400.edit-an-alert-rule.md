# Edit an alert rule

A system administrator and OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) alert administrator can edit alert rules.

If an alert object is added to both an alert rule and an alert template, the alert rule in the alert template is applied, and the modifications here do not take effect. For more information about how to modify the alert rule for the object, see [Modify an alert template](../400.manage-alert-templates/600.edit-an-alert-template.md).

## Prerequisites

The logged-on user in the OCP console is granted the ADMIN or ALARM_MANAGER role.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Alert Center**.

3. On the **Alert Rules** tab, find the specified alert rule.

4. In the **Actions** column of the alert rule, click the **More** icon (**...**) and select **Edit** to reconfigure the alert rule.

   For more information, see [Create an alert rule](../300.manage-alert-rules/100.create-an-alert-rule.md).

5. Click **Submit**.
