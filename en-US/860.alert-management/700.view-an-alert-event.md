# View alert events

This topic describes how to view details about an alert event and temporarily block an alert event.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Alert Center**.

3. By default, the **Alert Events** tab appears.

4. Specify search criteria in the search area. All alert events that match the search criteria will be displayed in the **Alert Events** list.

   * You can search for an alert event by **Application**, **Object Type**, **Alert Level**, **Keyword**, **Start Time**, and **End Time**.

   * You can click **Active Alerts** and **Alert History** to switch between the alert lists.

   * You can click **Export Alert Event** to export all alert events that match the search criteria to your computer.

   * If alert pushes are configured for the alert event, you can click **Failed** in the **Message Push** column to view details about the alert event.

   * If no alert push is configured for the alert event, you can click **Message Push Not Configured** in the **Message Push** column to configure alert pushes for the alert event. For more information, see [Create an alert push](600.manage-alert-push/100.create-an-alert-push.md).

   * For an active alert event of the **Log** type that occurs only once and needs to be manually acknowledged, the Actions column provides two options: **Resolved** and **Mask Alerts**.

      * If the alert event has been resolved, you can click **Resolved** in the **Actions** column to clear the alert. After the alert is cleared, you cannot perform any operations on it.

      * If the alert event does not need to be concerned, you can click **Mask Alerts** in the **Actions** column to quickly block the alert message. Then the alert will not be reported before the block period expires. For more information, see [Create a blocking condition](800.manage-blocking-conditions/100.create-a-blocking-condition.md).

5. Click the description in the Alert Description column of an alert event. The **Details** page of the alert event appears.

   1. In the **Basic Information** section, view the basic information of the alert event.

      * Click the name of an alert object to view its details.
      * Click the name of an alert rule to view its details. To modify an alert rule, click **Edit Alert Rule** on the details page of the rule. For more information, see [Edit an alert rule](300.manage-alert-rules/400.edit-an-alert-rule.md).
      * Click **Suggestions on How to Deal with Alerts** to view the suggestions on handling the alert.

   2. In the **Alert Event History** section, view the alert event history and related information, including **Alert Time**, **Alert Level**, and **Alert Status**.

   3. View the alert notification history in the **Alert Messages** list.

   4. On the details page of the alert event, click **Mask Alerts** in the upper-right corner to block alert messages.

      Then the alert will not be reported before the block period expires.

   5. On the details page of the alert event, click **Alert Analysis Data** in the upper-right corner to download the logs related to alert analysis.

6. When many alert events are received, you can clear alert messages as needed.

   1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Parameter Management**.
   2. Search for the `ocp.alarm.notification.expired-days` parameter in the parameter list to set the retention period of alert messages, in days.

      After you specify this parameter, the alert messages and alert events that exceed the retention period will be deleted. The following data will be deleted upon expiration:

      * `ocp2_alarm_notification`
      * `ocp_alarm_event_notification`
      * `ocp2_alarm_event_history`
      * `ocp_alarm_event_record`
      * `ocp2_alarm_filter` (Cleared data will be written to `ocp2_alarm_filter_history`. The amount of rule information is small and therefore the rule history table does not need to be cleared.)

     <main id="notice" type='notice'>
     <h4>Notice</h4>
