# Create an alert channel

This topic describes how to create an alert channel.

## Background information

Alerting is a standalone feature. If you do not configure alert channels, you can view alerts only on the **Alert Events** page of the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. You can configure alert channels to receive alert notifications.

Notifications are sent through alert channels. The following channel types are supported:

* DingTalk

* Feishu

* WeChat Enterprise

* Email

* HTTP

* Custom script: OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) supports Python and Bash scripts. For more information, see the **Custom script channel** section in [Examples of alert channel configuration](../500.manage-alert-channels/600.examples-of-alert-channel-configuration.md).

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You can configure the time variables for alert aggregation when you configure a channel. After an alert channel is updated, the channel restarts alert aggregation. If an alert has not been cleared at that time, you may receive the alert notification again during the aggregation period.</p>
  </main>

OCP provides a default alert channel. You need to configure it before use and you cannot delete it.

## Prerequisites

* The basic information of the recipients is configured.

* The logged-on user has administrator permissions.

## Procedure

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>We recommend that you read <a href="700.alarm-channel-settings-example.md">Examples of alert channel configuration</a> before you perform the following steps.</p>
  </main>

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alert** > **Alerts**.

3. On the **Alert Channels** tab, click **Create Channel**.

4. Specify the fields in the **Basic Information** section of the channel as prompted.

   The fields to be specified vary with the channel type.

5. When **Channel Type** is **HTTP**, **Email**, or **Custom Script**, specify the fields as prompted.

   The following table describes the fields to be specified when **Channel Type** is **HTTP**.

   | Field | Description |
   |------|-------|
   | Proxy | Specify the proxy server that sends alerts, in the format of `http:ip:port`. In the format, `ip` represents the IP address of the proxy server, and `port` represents the port that is assigned to send alerts.  For example, if the IP address of the proxy server is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and port 80 is assigned, you can set Proxy to `http:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80`.  |
   | Request Method | Select the request method as needed.  |
   | URL Template | Enter the URL for sending alert information.  |
   | Header Template | Enter the template for HTTP headers. Multiple headers are entered in the format of </br> <code>Content-Type:application/json</br>x-lt-openKey:diskJitterAlarm</br>charset:utf-8</code>. |
   | Body Template | Enter the template for the notification content.  |
   | Response Verification Information | Optional. <ul><li> Responses vary with channels. You must configure the response verification information for OCP to accurately determine whether a message is successfully sent. </li> <li> You must enter the response verification information as a JSON string. OCP will parse the fields in the JSON string and match them with the corresponding information in the body of the channel response. If all fields are successfully matched, OCP determines that the alert message is successfully sent. </li> <li> If you are not sure of the channel response, you can set it to {}. In this way, OCP will always assume that the messages are successfully sent. </li><ul> |

   You can enable the channel aggregate feature to avoid repeatedly sending the same alert within a period. Since OCP V4.1.0, an alert is generated every 3 minutes by default. After you enable channel aggregate, an alert is sent only once every 10 minutes (600 seconds). 

7. Click **Send Test Message**. If the message is sent, click **Submit**.
