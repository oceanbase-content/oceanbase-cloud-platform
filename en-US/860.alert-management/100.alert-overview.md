# Overview

This topic describes how OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) monitors alerts and sends notifications when an error is detected in an OceanBase cluster or application.

## Introduction

OCP provides alerting and monitoring services for OceanBase clusters, tenants, and their resources so that you can detect business operation failures and resource shortages as soon as possible.

## Alert events

On the **Alarm Events** tab, you can search for alert events by **Application, Object Type, Alert Level, Keyword, Start Time**, and **End Time**.

Alert events are classified into active alerts and historical alerts.

* Active alerts: alerts in the Alerting or Blocked state.
* Historical alerts: alerts in the Cleared or Expired state.

In the alert event list, you can view information about alerts in the following fields: **Alert Description, Alert Object, Alert Type, Generated At, Recovery Time, Alert Status, Alert Level**, and **Message Push**. You can also sort the alert events by **Generated At**, **Recovery Time**, or **Alert Level**.

## Alert masking

You can search for alerts by specifying the **Application, Masked Object Types, Created By**, and **Keyword** fields. In the masking list, you can view alert information in the following columns: **Masked Application/Object Type, Blocking Object, Mask Alert Rules, Blocking End Time, Daily Block Period, Created By, Created At** and **Actions**. For more information, see [Create a blocking condition](800.manage-blocking-conditions/100.create-a-blocking-condition.md), [Edit a blocking condition](800.manage-blocking-conditions/200.edit-a-blocking-condition.md), and [Delete a blocking condition](800.manage-blocking-conditions/300.delete-a-blocking-condition.md).
