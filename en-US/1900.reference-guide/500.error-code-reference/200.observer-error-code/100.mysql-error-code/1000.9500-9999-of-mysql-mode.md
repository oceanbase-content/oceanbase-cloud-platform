## ERROR 9526 (HY000): identifier '%.\*s' too long


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9526

* Cause: The label name is too long. It can be up to 128 characters in length.

* Solution: Modify the label name.

## ERROR 9527 (HY000): a static method cannot be invoked on an instance value


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9527

* Cause: An instance cannot invoke static functions.

* Solution: Modify the invocation method to invoke functions by type name.

## ERROR 9528 (HY000): constructor method name must match type name


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9528

* Cause: The constructor name is not the same as the type name.

* Solution: Make sure that the constructor name is the same as the type name.

## ERROR 9529 (HY000): previous use of '%.\*s' conflicts with this use


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9529

* Cause: A name conflict occurred. For example, variables of different types have duplicate names.

* Solution: Make sure that each variable name is unique.

## ERROR 9530 (HY000): the SELF parameter can be declared only as IN or as IN OUT


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9530

* Cause: The modifier of the `SELF` parameter must be `IN` or `IN OUT`.

* Solution: Modify the modifier as required.

## ERROR 9531 (HY000): MAP methods must return a scalar type


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9531

* Cause: A `MAP` function must return scalar values but not complex values.

* Solution: Change the type of returned values.

## ERROR 9532 (HY000): MAP methods must be declared without any parameters other than (optional) SELF


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9532

* Cause: A `MAP` function can contain only the `SELF` parameter. The `SELF` parameter can be explicitly or implicitly defined.

* Solution: Remove the excess parameters.

## ERROR 9533 (HY000): ORDER methods must return an INTEGER


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9533

* Cause: An `ORDER` function must return integers.

## ERROR 9534 (HY000): The parameter type in an ORDER method must be the containing object type


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9534

* Cause: The parameter type of an `ORDER` function must be the same as the corresponding object type.

* Solution: Change the parameter type.

## ERROR 9535 (HY000): Within SQL statements, only equality comparisons of objects are allowed without a map or order function


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9535

* Cause: Only equality comparison is allowed because the SQL statement contains no `MAP` or `ORDER` function.

* Solution: Add a `MAP` function or an `ORDER` function, or perform only equality comparison.

## ERROR 9537 (HY000): The parameters to an ORDER function must have IN mode


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9537

* Cause: The parameter modifier of an `ORDER` function must be `IN`.

* Solution: Modify the parameter modifier.

## ERROR 9538 (HY000): ORDER methods must be declared with 1 (one) parameter in addition to (optional) SELF


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9538

* Cause: An `ORDER` function cannot contain only the `SELF` parameter.

* Solution: Define a parameter of the required type in addition to the `SELF` parameter.

## ERROR 9539 (HY000): type '%.\*s' is malformed because it is a non-REF mutually recursive type


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9539

* Cause: The type encountered a recursive reference.

* Solution: Remove the recursive reference.

## ERROR 9540 (HY000): $ERROR: %.\*s


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9540

* Cause: The `$ERROR` instruction triggered an expected error.

* Solution: Troubleshooting is not required.

## ERROR 9541 (HY000): RETURN statement in a CONSTRUCTOR cannot include an expression


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9541

* Cause: The `RETURN` statement of the `CONSTRUCTOR` function cannot contain any expression.

* Solution: Remove the expression from the `RETURN` statement.

## ERROR 9542 (HY000): wrong number or types of arguments in call to '%.\*s'


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9542

* Cause: No matching function was found when the subprocedure was called because the function name, number of parameters, or the parameter type is invalid.

* Solution: Check the specified function name, number of parameters, and parameter type. If the error persists, check the access scope of the function.

## ERROR 9543 (HY000): '%.\*s' must be a type


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9543

* Cause: The type modifier used in the declaration or expression is invalid. For example, `%type` or `%rowtype` is missing.

* Solution: Modify the type modifier as required.

## ERROR 9544 (HY000): too many declarations of '%.\*s' match this call


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9544

* Cause: Multiple function invocation methods are matched. This may be because multiple function invocation methods exist for the function to be invoked and no method can be exactly matched.

* Solution: Make sure that the function name and parameter type are valid.

## ERROR 9694 (42000): Duplicate condition information item '%s'


* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9694

* Cause: The definition of condition contains duplicate items.
