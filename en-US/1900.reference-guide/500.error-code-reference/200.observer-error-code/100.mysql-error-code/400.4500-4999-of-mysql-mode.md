# 4500 to 4999

These error codes indicate RootService errors.

## ERROR 4507 (42000): Convert error

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4507

* Cause: An IP address is included in a string.

* Solution: This is an internal error code. Contact OceanBase Technical Support for troubleshooting.

## ERROR 4512 (HY000): RootServer state error

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4512

* Cause: The current status of the RootServer does not support the operation.

* Solution: Check the current status of the RootServer. You can query the `__all_virtual_core_meta_table` table to check whether the RootServer is online.

## ERROR 4515 (HY000): No replica is valid

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4515

* Cause: The replica status is invalid.

* Solution: This is an internal error code. Contact OceanBase Technical Support for troubleshooting.

## ERROR 4519 (HY000): Iteration was stopped

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4519

* Cause: This error code does not indicate an error but indicates that the MemTable iteration ends.

* Solution: Troubleshooting is not required.

## ERROR 4530 (HY000): Zone info \\'%s\\' not exist

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4530

* Cause: The specified zone does not exist. Generally, this error occurs during a major compaction of a specified zone or a switchover of the primary zone.

* Solution: Check whether the specified zone exists. You can query the `DBA_OB_ZONES` table to obtain the required information.

## ERROR 4544 (42000): Root not integrated

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4544

* Cause: During a rotating major compaction, the system checks whether the available replicas in each partition constitute the majority of replicas in the current partition. This error occurs if the available replicas in a partition are fewer than the majority of replicas.

* Solution: Immediately check why the majority of replicas in the partition are unavailable.

## ERROR 4547 (HY000): global merge not started

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4547

* Cause: This error occurs in the precheck before a manual rotating major compaction. A manual major compaction is not allowed for a cluster if no major freeze has been initiated for the cluster.

* Solution: Check whether a major freeze has been initiated for the cluster.

## ERROR 4548 (HY000): merge already started

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4548

* Cause: This error occurs in the precheck before a manual rotating major compaction. If a manual major compaction has been initiated for a zone, you cannot initiate another manual major compaction for the cluster.

* Solution: Check whether a manual major compaction has been initiated for the zone.

## ERROR 4549 (HY000): rootservice already exist

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4549

* Cause: This code is returned in the self-check before the current RootService replica starts. If another RootService replica is already running, the current RootService replica does not start.

* Solution: Troubleshooting is not required.

## ERROR 4550 (HY000): rootservice is shutdown

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4550

* Cause: The RootService replica that receives the current request is inactive because no leader is elected or the request is sent to a follower.

* Solution: Retry the request. If no leader is elected for RootService replicas, further troubleshooting is required.

## ERROR 4551 (HY000): server migrate in denied

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4551

* Cause: The OBServer node fails to execute the `balance task` due to reasons such as a full disk or an excessive number of partitions. As a result, the OBServer node returns a package indicating the `balance task` execution failure to the RootService and returns this error code.

* Solution: The RootService automatically stops scheduling tasks to the OBServer node and then re-schedules tasks to the OBServer node after the specified period elapses. If the OBServer node continuously returns this error code, check whether the disk is overloaded and whether excessive partitions are in use.

## ERROR 4552 (HY000): rebalance task can not executing now

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4552

* Cause: Before executing a `balance task`, the RootService checks whether the leader is successfully switched, whether the replica already exists on the destination server, and whether the replica schema exists. If the check results indicate that the `balance task` cannot be executed, the task execution ends, and this error is returned.

* Solution: Check the execution conditions of the `balance task` and identify the specific cause of the execution failure. For example, if the leader fails to be switched before migration, identify the cause of the leader switchover failure.

## ERROR 4554 (HY000): rebalance task not in progress on observer

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4554

* Cause: The RootService periodically sends RPC packets to the OBServer node to check whether each `balance task` exists. If a `balance task` no longer exists, the RootService marks the end of the `balance task` and returns this error code.

* Solution: This error usually occurs if the response from meta_table is delayed or the response from the `balance task` to the RootService is lost. Usually, troubleshooting is not required.

## ERROR 4605 (HY000): Data source timeout

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4605

* Cause: The current RPC timed out during migration and replication at the storage layer.

* Solution: Check the cause of the timeout error, or extend the timeout period.

## ERROR 4615 (HY000): tablegroup is not empty

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4615

* Cause: When you delete a table group, this error occurs in any one of the following scenarios:

   * The specified table group contains tables.

   * The table group specified by the `default_tablegroup_id` parameter of the database is deleted.

   * The table group specified by the `default_tablegroup_id` parameter of the tenant is deleted.

* Solution: Delete all tables in the specified table group but retain the table group specified by the `default_tablegroup_id` parameter.

## ERROR 4620 (HY000): server status is not valid

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4620

* Cause: One or more OBServer node parameters are invalid.

* Solution: Modify the OBServer node parameter settings.

## ERROR 4621 (HY000): wait elect partition leader timeout

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4621

* Cause: Leader election timed out.

* Solution: Check the cause of the timeout, or extend the timeout period.

## ERROR 4622 (HY000): wait all rs online timeout

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4622

* Cause:

   1. The system checks whether the OBServer node that runs the RootService is in the `ALIVE` state during bootstrapping. This error occurs if the server is not in the `ALIVE` state.

   2. The system checks whether the OBServer node that runs the RootService is in the `in_service` state or whether the value of `start_service_time` is `0` during bootstrapping. This error occurs if the server is not in the `in_service` state or the value of `start_service_time` is not `0`.

* Solution: Check the cause of the timeout, or extend the timeout period.

## ERROR 4624 (HY000): zone '%s' server \'%s\' %s resource is not enough to hold a new unit

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4624

* Cause:

   1. The system checks whether resources are sufficient during resource allocation in scenarios such as creating or modifying a resource pool, migrating resource units, or supplementing replicas. This error occurs if resources are insufficient.

   2. The system checks whether resources are sufficient when you create a table. This error occurs if resources are insufficient.

* Solution: Adjust the amount of resources to be allocated based on the specific cause.

## ERROR 4626 (HY000): resource pool \\'%s\\' has already been granted to a tenant

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4626

* Cause: The resource pool is being used by a tenant.

* Solution: Query the `__all_resource_pool` table to obtain the `tenant_id` value of the tenant that is using the resource pool. Then, perform one of the following operations:

   * Delete the tenant.

   * Remove the resource pool from the tenant.

   * Create another resource pool without using the current resource pool.

* Solution: This error is reported for preventive purposes, indicating that you cannot run the `delete server` command again.

## ERROR 4629 (HY000): server is not in deleting status

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4629

* Cause: This error is reported for preventive purposes, indicating that the `delete server` task has ended.

* Solution: This is an internal error code. Contact OceanBase Technical Support for troubleshooting.

## ERROR 4630 (HY000): server not in server white list

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4630

* Cause: The OBServer node is not in the current cluster. This error is an internal error and may occur in one of the following scenarios:

   * The RootService is switched to the server but has not provided services.

   * The cluster is in the bootstrapping process.

   * The `add server` command is not run for the server.

   * The server sends a request to the current cluster.

* Solution:

   * If the RootService is switched to the server but has not provided services or the cluster is in the bootstrapping process, and this error occurs only temporarily, troubleshooting is not required.

   * If the `add server` command is not run for the server, run the `add server` command.

   * If the cluster also exists in another database, contact OceanBase Technical Support for troubleshooting.

## ERROR 4631 (HY000): server zone not match

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4631

* Solution: If a zone is specified, check whether the OBServer node and zone in the `__all_server` table match.

## ERROR 4632 (HY000): zone num has reach max zone num

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4632

* Cause: This error is reported for preventive purposes when you run the `add zone` command, indicating that the number of existing zones exceeds 64.

* Solution: Run the `delete zone` command to remove zones that are not in use.

## ERROR 4633 (HY000): zone status not match

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4633

* Cause: This error is reported for preventive purposes when you run the `delete/start zone` command. When you run the `delete zone` command, the specified zone must be in the `inactive` state. When you run the `start zone` command, the specified zone must be in a state other than `active`.

* Solution: Query the `DBA_OB_ZONES` table to check the status of the zone. If the zone is in an unexpected state, contact OceanBase Technical Support for troubleshooting.

## ERROR 4634 (HY000): resource unit \\'%s\\' is referenced by some resource pool

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4634

* Cause: The resource unit to be deleted or used is being referenced by a resource pool.

* Solution:

   1. Query the `__all_unit_config` or `__all_resource_pool` table to find the resource pool that is referencing the resource unit.

   2. Execute the `ALTER RESOURCE POOL` statement to remove the resource unit from the resource pool, or execute the `DROP RESOURCE POOL` statement to directly delete the resource pool.

   3. Execute the `DROP RESOURCE UNIT` or `ALTER RESOURCE POOL` statement to delete or directly use the resource unit.

## ERROR 4636 (HY000): table schema primary zone different with other table in same tablegroup
