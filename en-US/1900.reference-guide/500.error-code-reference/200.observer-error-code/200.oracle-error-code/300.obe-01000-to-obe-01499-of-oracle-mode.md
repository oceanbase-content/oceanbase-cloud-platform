## OBE-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5930

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The maximum number of open cursors allowed is exceeded.

## OBE-01001: invalid cursor

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5844

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The specified cursor is invalid.

## OBE-01002: fetch out of sequence

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5931

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: You are attempting to fetch data from an invalid cursor. Possible causes:

  * The data is fetched from the cursor after the retrieval reaches the last line and the `OBE-1403` error is returned.

  * The `FOR UPDATE` clause is used to open the cursor, and then the data is fetched after the `COMMIT` statement is issued.

  * All placeholders in the SQL statement are re-bound, and the data is fetched before the statement is re-executed.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>This error can also occur if a PL cursor is circularly and implicitly fetched. </p>
  </main>

* Solution:

  * Do not issue the `FETCH` statement after the retrieval reaches the last line.

  * After you use the `FOR UPDATE` clause to open the cursor, do not fetch the data after you issue the `COMMIT` statement.

  * Bind placeholders again, execute the SQL statement, and then fetch the data.

## OBE-01003: no statement parsed

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9678

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: DBMS_SQL PARSE attempts to parse a DDL statement.

* Solution: Change the type of the statement to be parsed by DBMS_SQL PARSE to `SELECT`.

## OBE-01402: view WITH CHECK OPTION where-clause violation

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5971

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The DML operation performed on the view violated the `WITH CHECK OPTION` constraint on the view.

* Solution: The data inserted into the view by using the `INSERT` statement or the data updated by using the `UPDATE` statement must meet the `WHERE` condition in the view definition.

## OBE-01451: column to be modified to NULL cannot be modified to NULL

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5850

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* SQLSTATE: HY000
* Cause: The snapshot is too old to be correctly read or parsed because the table definition has changed.  
* Solution: Check whether a column is added or deleted, or whether the data type or length is modified, and perform troubleshooting based on the actual situation.
