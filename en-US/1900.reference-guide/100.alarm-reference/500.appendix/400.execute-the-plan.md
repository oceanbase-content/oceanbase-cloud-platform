# Execute the alert clearance plan

This topic describes the alert clearance plan feature of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). You can execute the alert clearance plans for some alerts to fix the alerted issues. 

## Alerts that support an alert clearance plan

| Alert | Description | Alert clearance plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| os_observer_not_exist | The observer process does not exist. | Reload the observer process when it unexpectedly exits. The observer process can be reloaded only once within 12 hours since the event occurs. |
| arbitration_service_unavailable | The arbitration service is unavailable. | Reload the observer process when the observer process of the server hosting the arbitration service unexpectedly exits. The observer process can be reloaded only once within 12 hours since the event occurs. |
| tenant_memstore_percent_over_threshold | The memory usage of an OceanBase Database tenant exceeds the threshold. | Scale up the tenant memory. |
| ob_tenant_request_queue_over_threshold | The length of the request queue of an OceanBase Database tenant exceeds the threshold. | Scale up the CPU resources of the tenant. |
| obproxy_client_connections_usage_over_threshold | The usage of client connections of an OBProxy exceeds the threshold. | Automatically increase the value of the cluster-level parameter that specifies the maximum number of connections allowed for an OBProxy. |
| oas_anomaly_sql_from_anomaly_event_analysis_perf_degradation | The CPU utilization of a host exceeds the threshold because the execution performance of an SQL statement has degraded. | Refresh the plan cache of the SQL statement. |
| oas_anomaly_sql_from_anomaly_event_analysis_plan_changed | The CPU utilization of a host exceeds the threshold because the execution plan of an SQL statement has deteriorated. | Refresh the plan cache of the SQL statement. |
| oas_anomaly_sql_from_sql_inspection_perf_degradation | It is detected during the SQL inspection that the execution performance of an SQL statement has degraded. | Refresh the plan cache of the SQL statement. |
| oas_anomaly_sql_from_sql_inspection_plan_changed | It is detected during the SQL inspection that the execution plan of an SQL statement has deteriorated. | Refresh the plan cache of the SQL statement. |

## Procedure

The ob_tenant_request_queue_over_threshold alert is used as an example. 

1. In the alert event list, click the name of the alert. 
2. On the details page of the alert, view the basic information of the alert and click **Execute Now** next to the name of the alert clearance plan. 

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Some alerts support automatic execution of an alert clearance plan. In this case, you can view the execution result on the alert details page. For more information, see Step 6. For example, the <code>os_observer_not_exist</code> and <code>arbitration_service_unavailable</code> alerts support automatic execution of their alert clearance plans. </p>
    </main>

3. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**. 

4. View the execution result. 

   1. The following figure shows a sample message if the execution of the alert clearance plan succeeds. 

   2. If the plan execution fails, you can retry or roll back the plan. 

      * Retry the alert clearance plan

         In the **View Execution Result** dialog box, click **Retry**. 

      * Roll back the alert clearance plan. You can contact OceanBase Technical Support for assistance. 

5. Click **Close** to return to the alert details page. 

6. You can click **View Successful Execution** or **View Failed Execution** to view the execution result.

   For more information about the execution result, see **Step 4**.
