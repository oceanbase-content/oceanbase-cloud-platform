# ob_tenant_task_timeout

## Description

This alert is triggered when it takes over three hours to execute a task in an OceanBase Database tenant. The following task types are supported:

* MIGRATE_UNIT: a unit migration task.
* ALTER_TENANT_LOCALITY: a task to modify the locality of a tenant.
* ROLLBACK_ALTER_TENANT_LOCALITY: a task to roll back the locality of a tenant.
* SHRINK_RESOURCE_TENANT_UNIT_NUM: a task to scale in the number of units of a tenant.

### Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Metric | ob_tenant_task_max_duration_seconds |
| Source | Internal views. SQL statements for metric collection:</br><li>In OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0: ```SELECT /*+ MONITOR_AGENT READ_CONSISTENCY(WEAK) */ tenant_id, task_type, max(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, sys_task_status.start_time, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ) ) max_sys_task_duration_seconds FROM __all_virtual_sys_task_status sys_task_status WHERE svr_ip = ? AND svr_port = ? GROUP BY tenant_id,task_type```</li><li>In OceanBase Database V4.0 or later: ```SELECT /* MONITOR_AGENT */ tenant_id, job_type as task_type, TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, START_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) as max_sys_task_duration_seconds, rs_svr_ip as svr_ip FROM DBA_OB_TENANT_JOBS WHERE job_status='INPROGRESS' AND rs_svr_ip=? and rs_svr_port=? UNION SELECT tenant_id, job_type as task_type, TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, START_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) as max_sys_task_duration_seconds, rs_svr_ip as svr_ip FROM DBA_OB_UNIT_JOBS WHERE tenant_id IS NOT NULL AND job_status='INPROGRESS' AND rs_svr_ip=? and rs_svr_port=?```</li> |

## Alert rule

| Metric expression | Metric description | Default threshold (unit: s) | Detection cycle | Time before clearance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ob_tenant_task_max_duration_seconds > 10800 | The timeout duration for the execution of a task in an OceanBase Database tenant. | 10800 (3 hours) | 60 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

| Trigger method | Alert level | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical | Tenant |

## Alert templates

* Alert overview: ${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
* Alert details: Cluster: ${ob_cluster_name}. Tenant: ${tenant_name}. Host: ${host} (zone: ${obzone}). Alert: A system task in the OceanBase Database tenant has timed out. Task Type: ${task_type}; Execution Time: ${value_shown}, which exceeds the threshold of ${alarm_threshold} seconds. 
* Overview example: ob_cluster=C1-1000:tenant_name=T1. A task in the OceanBase Database tenant timed out.
* Details example: Cluster: C1. Tenant: T1. Host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (zone: Z1). Alert: A system task in the OceanBase Database tenant has timed out. Task Type: MIGRATE_UNIT. Execution Time: 4 hours, which exceeds the threshold of 10800 seconds. 

## Impact on the system

* A prolonged task execution period affects task scheduling in OceanBase Database, which reduces the task processing throughput. 
* Prolonged occupation of resources affects the system stability. 
* If the task fails, for example, the migration of units fails, unbalanced unit distribution is caused and fragmented resources cannot be reused. 

## Possible causes

None. 

## Solutions

1. To migrate and modify units, you must ensure that the resources of the target server meet the requirements. Otherwise, the operation may fail. 
2. Check the `observer.log.wf` file for ERROR logs and submit the identified ERROR logs to OceanBase Technical Support for troubleshooting.
