## Impact on the system

If the arbitration service is unavailable, service reliability and high availability of the tenant are affected. If a tenant replica fails, the tenant cannot normally provide the arbitration service.

## Possible causes

* The server hosting the arbitration service is down.
* The port of the arbitration service cannot be accessed externally because the firewall is enabled.

## Solutions

1. Check whether the server hosting the arbitration service runs normally. If the server fails, restart the server and restart the arbitration service in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.
2. If the server is running normally, check whether the arbitration service process exists, whether the arbitration service port is listening normally, and whether the firewall prohibits access from other IP addresses.
