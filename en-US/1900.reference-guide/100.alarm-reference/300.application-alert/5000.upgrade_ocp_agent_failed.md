## Impact on the system

OCP-Agent is a process deployed on a host that is taken over by OCP. It comprises a management (O&M) process and a monitoring process. If OCP-Agent fails to be upgraded, the version of OCP-Agent will be inconsistent with that of OCP-Server and the following issues will be caused:

1. O&M operations, such as routine O&M operations on OceanBase Database, OceanBase Proxy (OBProxy), and hosts, cannot be performed.
2. Monitoring data of the later version cannot be collected.

## Possible causes

An upgrade may fail due to different causes. You must perform analysis based on the actual situation.
