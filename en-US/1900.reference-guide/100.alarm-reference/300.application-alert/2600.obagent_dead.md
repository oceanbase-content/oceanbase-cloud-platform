# obagent_dead

## Description

OCP-Agent is a collection of service programs installed on the host: ocp_monagent collects monitoring data from the hosts and OBServer nodes, ocp_mgragent performs O&M operations on OBServer nodes, and ocp_agentd is the daemon of the two services. If the daemon does not exist, OCP-Agent cannot work properly.

This alert is triggered when an OCP-Agent process on the host is abnormal.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>This alert is generated when the daemon does not exist but the monitoring process of OCP-Agent works normally.</p>
  </main>

## Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metric | host_agent_process_status</br>The value of `host_agent_process_status` indicates the process status. The value `1` indicates normal and `0` indicates abnormal.  |
| Source | The ocp_mgragent status API `http://ip:62888/api/v1/agent/status` is called to obtain the status of the ocp_agentd, ocp_monagent, and ocp_mgragent processes.  |
| Collected metric | host_agent_process_status |
| Metric expression | min(host_agent_process_status{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS) |
| Collection cycle | 30s |

## Alert rule

| Metric | Default threshold | Duration | Detection cycle | Time before clearance |
| ------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| host_agent_process_status | 0 | 0 seconds | 15 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

| Trigger method | Alert level | Scope |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Based on the expression of the metric | Stopped | Server |

## Alert templates

* Overview template: \${alarm_target} \${alarm_name}

* Details Template: Cluster: \${ob_cluster_name}; Host: \${host}; Alert: OCP-Agent process unavailable; Process name: \${agent_process}; Process status: ${process_status}.

* Overview example: svr_ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx OCP-Agent process unavailable

* Details example: Cluster: obcluster-1; Host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx; Alert: OCP-Agent process unavailable; Process name: ocp_monagent; Process status: unavailable.

## Impact on the system

1. If the ocp_agentd process does not exist, the processes related to OCP-Agent may stop and cannot automatically start, which causes the following consequences:

* If the ocp_monagent process is abnormal, monitoring data cannot be collected and alerts cannot be generated. As a result, you cannot identify system risks in a timely manner.

* If the ocp_monagent process is abnormal, you cannot perform O&M on OBServer nodes.

## Possible causes

1. The ocp_agentd process may be unexpectedly terminated because the host memory or disk is full.
2. The program has a bug. When ocp_agentd fails several times to start a process, it stops trying.

## Solutions

1. Check the usage of the disk or memory.

   Log on to the alerting host and run the following commands:

   ```shell
   # Check whether the usage of the disk under /home/admin is close to 100%. 
   df -B1
   
   # Check whether the available memory space is close to 0. 
   free -g
   ```

   * If the disk usage is close to 100%, perform the following steps to clear logs or add more disks.

      1. View large sub-directories in the `/home/admin/logs` directory.

         ```shell
         [root]#  du /home/admin/logs/
         4       /home/admin/logs/obproxy/minidump
         32      /home/admin/logs/obproxy/etc
         1261772 /home/admin/logs/obproxy/log
         1261812 /home/admin/logs/obproxy
         1261816 /home/admin/logs/
         ```

      2. Enter the log directory and delete obsolete logs.

         ```shell
         [root]# ll /home/admin/logs/obproxy/log
         [root]# cd /home/admin/logs/obproxy/log
         [root]# rm obproxy.67344.log.20210902*
         ```

      3. Restart the ocp_agentd process.

         ```shell
         [root]# cd /home/admin/ocp_agent
         [root]# python ocp_agent_ctl.py recover
         ```

   * If the available memory space is close to 0, perform the following steps to release the memory, and restart the process.

      1. Release the memory space.

         ```shell
         [root]# sync
         [root]# echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
         [root]# echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
         ```

      2. Restart the ocp_agentd process.

         ```shell
         [root]# cd /home/admin/ocp_agent
         [root]# python ocp_agent_ctl.py recover
         ```

   * If the remaining memory and disk space are sufficient, proceed to the next step.

2. Collect related logs in the `ocp_agentd.log`, `ocp_monagent.error.log`, and `ocp_mgragent.error.log` files in the `file/home/admin/ocp_agent/log/` directory and related alert information, and send them to OceanBase Technical Support to locate the issue.
   * The `ocp_monagent.error.log` file may contain the keyword `panic`, which may cause the program to crash. You can search for the keyword and provide the logs to OceanBase Technical Support for troubleshooting.

      ```shell
      [root]# tail -1000 /home/admin/ocp_agent/log/ocp_monagent.error.log | grep -10 panic
      ```
