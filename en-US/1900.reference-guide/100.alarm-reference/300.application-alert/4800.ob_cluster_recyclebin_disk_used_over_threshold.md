## Alert templates

* Overview

  * Template: ${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
  * Sample: alarm_template_id=0:ob_cluster=Test-1 ob_cluster_recyclebin_disk_used_over_threshold

* Details

  * Template: Cluster: ${ob_cluster_name}. Alert: ${alarm_name} The disk space occupied by the data in the recycle bin is ${value_shown}, which exceeds ${alarm_threshold} GB.
  * Sample: Cluster: Test. Alert: ob_cluster_recyclebin_disk_used_over_threshold The disk space occupied by data in the recycle bin is 120 GB, which exceeds 100 GB.

## Impact on the system

If a large amount of data is cleaned up and the recycle bin is enabled, a lot of system resources will be wasted.

## Possible causes

* The recycle bin is enabled and a large amount of data is truncated and moved to the recycle bin. However, the recycle bin has a long purging interval. For example, if you execute the `alter system set recyclebin_object_expire_time='7d'` statement, data in the recycle bin will be purged in seven days.

* The recycle bin is enabled and a large amount of data is accumulated after some time. However, automatic purging is disabled for the recycle bin. In this case, you must set a purging interval.

## Solutions

1. Check whether the recycle bin needs to be enabled.

   * Statement for enabling or disabling the recycle bin: `set GLOBAL recyclebin = on / off;`
   * Statement for enabling or disabling flashback for the recycle bin: `set GLOBAL ob_enable_truncate_flashback = on /off;`

   If you want to enable the recycle bin, you can configure an appropriate purging interval. For example, you can execute the `alter system set recyclebin_object_expire_time='7d'` statement to set the purging interval to seven days. Data in the recycle bin will be purged in seven days.

2. Manually purge the data in the recycle bin.

   * Execute the `SHOW RECYCLEBIN;` statement to view objects in the recycle bin.
   * Execute the `PURGE DATABASE object_name;` statement to purge specified objects from the recycle bin.
   * Execute the `PURGE TABLE object_name;` statement to purge specified tables from the recycle bin.
   * Execute the `PURGE RECYCLEBIN;` statement to purge the entire recycle bin.
