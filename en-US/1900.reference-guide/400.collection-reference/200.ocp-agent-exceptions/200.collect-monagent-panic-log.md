# Collect panic logs of the monagent process

## Description

You can obtain panic logs of the monagent process from the host.

## Statement

```bash
cat ${ocp.agent.home.path}/log/ocp_monagent.error.log | grep -80 panic || true
```

A panic log is generated when the running status of the monagent process is not as expected, such as when a runtime error occurs due to a configuration error. In this case, we recommend that you contact OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Technical Support for assistance.
