# Collect obstack information on a cluster node

## Description

If you use OceanBase Database on a x86_64 platform, you can run the `obstack` command on the host to collect the command execution result.

## Statement

```sql
${ocp.agent.home.path}/bin/obstack_x86_64 $(pgrep observer) -o
```

## Additional information

OBStack calls the `kill -60 $observer` command. It can directly parse the address information of thread stacks into function names and aggregate the information. This way, you can quickly find the hotspot thread stack code of all threads on the OBServer node.
