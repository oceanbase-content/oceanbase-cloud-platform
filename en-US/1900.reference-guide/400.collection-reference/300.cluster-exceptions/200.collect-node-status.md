# Collect information about OBServer nodes in a cluster

## Description

You can query the `__all_server` system table for the running status of OBServer nodes in a cluster.

## Statement

```SQL
SELECT /*+READ_CONSISTENCY(WEAK),query_timeout(100000000)*/ *
FROM __all_server
WHERE status = "active"
	OR start_service_time = 0
	OR stop_time > 0;
```

## Troubleshooting method

* If the `stop_time` value in the `__all_server` system table is not `0` and the `status` value is `active`, the observer process is stopped on the OBServer node and cannot provide services.
* After a started OBServer node establishes a heartbeat connection with RootService, the status of the OBServer node is marked as `ACTIVE` in OceanBase Database.

If you query the `__all_server` table now, the status of the OBServer node is `ACTIVE` but the `start_service_time` value is `0`. The details are as follows:

```sql
obclient> select svr_ip,status,start_service_time from __all_server;
+----------------+--------+--------------------+
| svr_ip         | status | start_service_time |
+----------------+--------+--------------------+
| xxx.xx.xxx.1 | active |                  0 |
| xxx.xx.xxx.2 | active |   1617702133437712 |
| xxx.xx.xxx.3 | active |   1617702146772849 |
