# Collect suggestions provided based on historical major compactions

## Description

You can query the suggestions provided based on the major compaction history of a cluster.

## Statement

OceanBase Database V3.2.4 and later:

```sql
SELECT * FROM __all_virtual_compaction_suggestion;
```

## Troubleshooting method

You can query the suggestions provided based on the major compaction history, including:

1. The execution time is excessively long due to table partitions with a large amount of data.
2. A hardware fault may have occurred because the amount of compacted data does not conform to the time consumed in the major compaction.
3. The reuse rate of macroblocks is low due to random data insertion into large tables.
4. Data ranges are improperly defined for parallel compactions.
