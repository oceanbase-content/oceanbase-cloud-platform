# Collect information about DAG warnings in OceanBase Database

## Description

You can query the `__all_virtual_dag_warning_history` virtual table for the failure reason and trace ID when a minor or major compaction fails.

## Statement

OceanBase Database V3.2.0 and later:

```sql
SELECT * FROM __all_virtual_dag_warning_history;
```

After you obtain the trace ID, view the failure reason in the observer.log file based on the time value of the `gmt_modified` column in the result set.
