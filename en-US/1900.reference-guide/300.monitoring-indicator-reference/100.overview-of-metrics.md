# Overview of metrics

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to monitor the performance and resource usage of OceanBase clusters, OceanBase Database tenants, OBProxy clusters, and OBProxy hosts. You can view the monitoring data to learn about the status, performance, and resource usage of each monitored object. This way, you can ensure the availability of follow-up businesses by adjusting resource allocation in time. You can also troubleshoot business exceptions based on the monitoring data.

## Summary

The following table lists the four dimensions from which a metric and its sub-metrics are described.

| Dimension | Note |
|--------|--------|
| Definition | A brief introduction to the statistics monitored by the metric.  |
| Description | The information that further describes the metric. The following three parts are included:  <li> Display name: the name of the sub-metric displayed in the OCP console. A hyphen (-) is displayed if the metric contains no sub-metrics.    </li><li> Name: the metric name that is used in a query request sent to the backend and carries monitoring data.    </li><li> Unit: the unit of the returned monitoring data.  </li> |
| Calculation expression | Specifies how monitoring data is generated.  |
| Collection SQL | The SQL statements for metric collection. The SQL statements for metric collection vary in OceanBase Database of different versions. <blockquote>**Note**</br>Some metrics are collected without using SQL statements and therefore are not described from the Collection SQL dimension. </blockquote> |

## Principle of monitoring

The following figure shows the sources and destinations of monitoring data.

![1213](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1045805461/p403696.png)

1. Monitoring data is collected by the ocp_exporter process of OCP-Agent based on metrics.

2. OCP-Server triggers data collection based on the instances in ocp_exporter_address. The collected data is saved in MonitorDB.

3. The collected data is aggregated and calculated based on the specified calculation expression to generate the statistics to be displayed on console pages. Sample calculation expression:

   ```sql
   sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40000",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) + sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40002",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) + sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40004",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) + sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40006",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) + sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40008",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) + sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40018",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS)
   ```

   * LABELS: the labels based on which the data is filtered.

   * GBLABELS: the dimension from which the selected data is aggregated.

   * INTERVAL: the granularity of data aggregation. The value is determined by the statistical granularity that you specified.

4. The generated data is carried by metrics and is displayed in the form of trend charts in the OCP console.

   If a metric has sub-metrics, the data is carried by the sub-metrics to the OCP console.

## View monitoring data

You can specify a time window, a statistical granularity, and a statistical scope on a monitoring data page in the OCP console to query specific data as needed. To go to the monitoring data page, use one of the following methods:

<main id="notice" type='explain'>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>OCP supports the execution of asynchronous background tasks to calculate the monitoring data in advance and avoid real-time query for each collection. This reduces the peak CPU workload and accelerates the loading of monitoring APIs. You can specify whether to enable the asynchronous calculation feature by using the <code>ocp.metric.async-compute.enabled</code> parameter.

### View the monitoring data of an OceanBase cluster

* Method 1

   1. Log on to the OCP console.

   2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

   3. In the left-side navigation pane on the page that appears, click **Performance Monitoring**.

* Method 2

   1. Log on to the OCP console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alerts** > **Monitoring**. By default, the **OceanBase Clusters** tab appears.

## Concepts

* Collection granularity: the frequency at which the ocp_exporter process collects data from the monitored objects. Data can be collected at a granularity of one or more seconds, minutes, or hours, depending on the metric type.

* Time window: the time range of the monitoring data displayed in the OCP console.

* Statistical granularity: the granularity at which OCP aggregates the collected data. The granularity can be 1 minute or 1 second. If you set the granularity to 1 minute, minute-level statistics are displayed. If you set the granularity to 1 second, second-level statistics are displayed.

* Statistical scope: the scope of displayed monitoring data. OceanBase Database is a distributed database service. The overall monitoring data of a cluster or a tenant is obtained by aggregating the monitoring data of all zones or OBServer nodes of the cluster or tenant. By default, the OCP console displays the overall monitoring data of a cluster or a tenant. You can set the statistic scope to a single zone or OBServer node. Then, only the monitoring data within the specified scope is displayed.
