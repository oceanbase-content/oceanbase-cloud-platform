# sys500 memory occupation

This topic describes performance metrics related to **sys500 memory occupation** in an OceanBase cluster. You can specify a statistical range to query the metrics in a single zone or on a single OBServer node of an OceanBase cluster.

## tenant500_memory

### Definition

The size of memory (excluding OB_KVSTORE_CACHE_MB) occupied by the sys500 tenant on an OBServer node of a cluster within the specified statistical range.

### Description

| **Metric** | **Metric name** | **Unit** |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| tenant500_memory | tenant500_mem_hold | Byte |

### Calculation expression

sum(ob_tenant500_memory_hold_bytes{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS) / 1073741824

### SQL statements for metric collection

* If you use OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0, execute the following statement:

   ```sql
   select /*+ MONITOR_AGENT READ_CONSISTENCY(WEAK) */ sum(hold) as hold, sum(used) as used from __all_virtual_memory_info where tenant_id = 500 and svr_ip = ? and svr_port = ? and mod_name <> 'OB_KVSTORE_CACHE_MB'
   ```

* If you use OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, execute the following statement:

   ```sql
   select /* MONITOR_AGENT */ sum(hold) as hold, sum(used) as used from V$OB_MEMORY where tenant_id = 500 and svr_ip = ? and svr_port = ? and MOD_NAME <> 'KvstorCacheMb
   ```

## tenant500_memory_percent

### Definition

The ratio of memory (excluding OB_KVSTORE_CACHE_MB) occupied by the sys500 tenant on an OBServer node of a cluster to total memory of the OBServer node. 

### Description

| **Metric** | **Metric name** | **Unit** |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| tenant500_memory_percent | tenant500_mem_hold_percent | % |

### Calculation expression

100 * sum(ob_tenant500_memory_hold_bytes{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS) / sum(ob_server_resource_memory_bytes{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS)

### SQL statements for metric collection

* Collected metric: ob_tenant500_memory_hold_bytes

   * If you use OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      select /*+ MONITOR_AGENT READ_CONSISTENCY(WEAK) */ sum(hold) as hold, sum(used) as used from __all_virtual_memory_info where tenant_id = 500 and svr_ip = ? and svr_port = ? and mod_name <> 'OB_KVSTORE_CACHE_MB'
      ```

   * If you use OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      select /* MONITOR_AGENT */ sum(hold) as hold, sum(used) as used from V$OB_MEMORY where tenant_id = 500 and svr_ip = ? and svr_port = ? and MOD_NAME <> 'KvstorCacheMb'
      ```

* Collected metric: ob_server_resource_memory_bytes

   * If you use OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V2.0, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      select /*+ MONITOR_AGENT READ_CONSISTENCY(WEAK) */ cpu_total, cpu_assigned, mem_total, mem_assigned,disk_total, cpu_assigned_percent, mem_assigned_percent from __all_virtual_server_stat where svr_ip = ? and svr_port = ?
      ```

   * If you use OceanBase Database V2.0 or later but earlier than V4.0, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      select /*+ MONITOR_AGENT READ_CONSISTENCY(WEAK) */ cpu_total,cpu_max_assigned as cpu_assigned,mem_total,mem_max_assigned as mem_assigned,disk_total, cpu_assigned_percent, mem_assigned_percent from __all_virtual_server_stat where svr_ip = ? and svr_port = ?
      ```

   * If you use OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
       select /* MONITOR_AGENT */ cpu_capacity_max as cpu_total,cpu_assigned_max as cpu_assigned,mem_capacity as mem_total,mem_assigned as mem_assigned,data_disk_capacity as disk_total, (cpu_assigned_max / cpu_capacity_max) as cpu_assigned_percent, (mem_assigned / mem_capacity) as mem_assigned_percent from V$OB_SERVERS where svr_ip = ? and svr_port = ?
      ```
