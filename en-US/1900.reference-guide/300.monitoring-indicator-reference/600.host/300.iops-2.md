# IOPS

This topic describes the performance metrics related to the **input/output operations per second (IOPS)** on a host. IOPS refers to the number of read and write operations performed per second on the disk.

## Background information

Host monitoring supports the monitoring of input/output operations per second (IOPS) on multiple mounted disks. If a host is mounted with multiple disks, multiple pairs of read and write metrics, such as sda: io_read and sda: io_write and sdb: io_read and sdb: io_write, are displayed.

The metric field names and calculation expressions of the metric pairs are the same.

## read

### Definition

The number of disk reads per second.

### Description

| **Metric** | **Metric field name** | **Unit** |
|------------|-----------------------|----------|
| read       | io_read               | count    |

### Calculation expression

avg(rate(node_disk_reads_completed_total{@LABELS}\[@INTERVAL\])) by (@GBLABELS)

## write

### Definition

The number of disk writes per second.

### Description

| **Metric** | **Metric field name** | **Unit** |
|------------|-----------------------|----------|
| write      | io_write              | count    |

### Calculation expression

avg(rate(node_disk_writes_completed_total{@LABELS}\[@INTERVAL\])) by (@GBLABELS)
