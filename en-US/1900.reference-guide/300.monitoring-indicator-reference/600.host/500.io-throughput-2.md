# I/O throughput

This topic describes performance metrics related to the **I/O throughput** of a host.

## Background information

Host monitoring supports the monitoring of input/output operations per second (IOPS) on multiple mounted disks. If a host is mounted with multiple disks, multiple pairs of read and write metrics, such as sda: io_read and sda: io_write and sdb: io_read and sdb: io_write, are displayed.

The metric field names and calculation expressions of the metric pairs are the same.

## read

### Definition

The average amount of data read from the disk per second.

### Description

| **Metric** | **Metric field name** | **Unit**  |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| read       | io_read_byte          | MiB |

### Calculation expression

avg(rate(node_disk_read_bytes_total{@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) / 1048576

## write

### Definition

The average amount of data written to the disk per second.

### Description

| **Metric** | **Metric field name** | **Unit**  |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| write      | io_write_byte         | MiB |

### Calculation expression

avg(rate(node_disk_written_bytes_total{@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) / 1048576
