# Call an alert API

This topic provides some sample scripts to show you how to call and test an alert API.

## Call an OCP alert API

The following script shows how to call the API that pushes alerts to OCP, so that OCP can process the alerts.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import base64
import requests
import json

data = {
    "alarmType": "your_alarm_type", 
    "labels": {"key":"value"}, 
    "target":"alarm_target",
}

base64userpass = base64.b64encode('{0}:{1}'.format('username', 'password'))
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    "Authorization": "Basic %s" % base64userpass,
}

resp = requests.post(url='http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080/api/v2/alarm/alarms', headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
jresp = json.loads(resp.text)
print(jresp)
```

## Send an alert from OCP

After an alert is generated in OCP, the alert message is sent through a specified alert channel. You can use a shell script or a Python scrip to configure an alert channel. The following example shows how to send an alert message through an alert channel. The `send_alarm` function retrieves the values of alert-related environment variables from the os.environ object. For a list of supported environment variables, see [OCP alert template variables](200.alert-events/100.query-the-alert-event-list.md).

Python script example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Note: The first line of the script must use a shebang to specify the program to use. Only Python and bash are supported.

import os
import sys

def send_alarm():
    message = os.environ['message']
    print("Alert message: {}".format(message))
    with open("./alarm_output.txt", "a") as file_object:
        file_object.write("{}\n".format(message))

def main():
    """
    Return 0 if succeeded.
    Return a non-zero value if failed. The error is printed to stderr.
    """
    try:
        send_alarm()
        print("send alarm success")
        return 0
    except Exception as e:
        sys.stderr.write(str(e))
        return 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```

## Test an alert

To test if an alert can be pushed to a third-party platform, take one of the following approaches.

1. You can trigger an alert in OCP by performing the following steps:

   * Suspend OCP Agent to trigger an agent-unavailable alert, for example, the `no_enough_exporter` alert.

   * Check if the third-party platform receives the alert.

2. The Alert Channel Configuration module of OCP provides a testing feature. You can start a test by clicking **Send Test Message** . For more information, see [Create an alert channel](../../../900.monitoring-and-alerts-functions/200.alert-management/500.manage-alert-channels/100.create-an-alert-channel.md).

3. You can call the API that pushes alerts to OCP, and then use an alert channel script to send the alert to a third-party platform.

## View alerts through APIs

This topic describes how to view OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) alerts on your alert platform.

### Background

You must call APIs to query OCP alerts on your alert platform. For more information, see [Query the alert event list](200.alert-events/100.query-the-alert-event-list.md).

### Scenario 1: View real-time alerts

The following sample code shows how to view real-time OCP alerts. You can call the corresponding API on a regular basis to query the alert event list and learn of the alert objects in real time.

#### Sample code

```javascript
curl 'http://OCP-IP:8080/api/v2/alarm/alarms?isSubscribedByMe=false&status=Active&page=1&size=10' \
--user username:password \
--compressed \
--insecure
```

The `data.page.totalPages` field indicates the total pages of real-time alerts. You can view the alerts on a specific page. For example, you can set the `page` field to 2 and view the alerts on Page 2:

```javascript
curl 'http://OCP-IP:8080/api/v2/alarm/alarms?isSubscribedByMe=false&status=Active&page=2&size=10' \
--user username:password \
--compressed \
--insecure
```

Key fields

| Field | Description |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| alarmType | The name of the alert rule.  |
| activeAt | The time when the alert was triggered, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). You need to convert it to the local time before use.  |
| updatedAt | The time when the alert was updated, in GMT. You need to convert it to the local time before use.  |
| target | The alert object, such as a tenant of a cluster.  |
| description | The description of the alert.  |
| summary | The summary of the alert.  |
| level | The alert level.  |
| labels | Other information, such as the cluster (obregion or ob_cluster in previous versions), tenant (tenant_name), or host IP address (svr_ip). A `labels` field suffixed with `_1`, `_2`, or `_3` is in non-standard format. We recommend that you use this format only when necessary. This field is not used in later versions of OCP.  For more information about supported labels, see [Examples of alert channel configuration](../../../900.monitoring-and-alerts-functions/200.alert-management/500.manage-alert-channels/600.examples-of-alert-channel-configuration.md). |

### Scenario 2: Connect to your alert platform

Based on the sample code in Scenario 1, you can call the corresponding API on a regular basis to query the alert event list and update the status of the alert object (target).

The following information is updated:

* The last alert time. You can calculate the duration of an alert based on the time when the alert was triggered.

* The alert status. If the alert of a target is not returned for each batch, the alert is set to the cleared state. When you query multiple pages, alerts on these pages are returned in a batch.

* The number of alerts of each alert level in the Alerting state in real time.

### Scenario 3: Verify alert availability

To prevent hidden dangers due to alert unavailability, you can trigger an alert on a regular basis based on the following sample code to verify the alert trace availability.

#### Sample code

1. You can trigger a log alert. For example, you can write the following ERROR log to the runtime log of an OBServer:

   ```javascript
   echo '[2035-01-02 15:04:05.666666] ERROR [CLOG] update_free_quota (ob_log_file_pool.cpp:413) [1994][2072][Y0-0000000000000000] [lt=19] [dc=0] test ob error for ocp alarm, just ignore. ret=-999999' >> /home/admin/oceanbase/log/observer.log.wf
   ```

2. Run the following command to call the API and verify the log alert:

3. Set the keyword in the request to the log content.

4. If the alert is displayed on your alert platform, the alert trace is working.
