Create a sampling strategy for recovery
=============================

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) can perform sampling on cluster backups to check whether the backup data can be recovered.

Background
-------------------------

After you configure a cluster backup strategy, OCP schedules cluster backup on a regular basis. After the backup is complete, you can manually initiate a recovery to check whether the backup data of the cluster can be properly restored. You can also enable sampling on OCP to automatically and regularly verify the recoverability of backup data.

Description
-------------------------

You can formulate a recovery sampling strategy based on your business needs. Then, OCP restores the backed up tenants in random order within the specified time range every day. You must specify a cluster as the recovery destination and create a recovery tenant for the recovery sampling strategy. Each time before OCP automatically restores data to a new tenant with a specified tenant name, it deletes the recovery tenant.

After you configure a recovery sampling strategy, OCP initiates sampling tasks everyday based on the strategy. You can select sample clusters and tenants to initiate multiple recovery tasks based on your business requirements. A sampling task includes:

* A strategy name

* A sampling time range

* A backup mode of the sample cluster (physical backup or logical backup)

* A sample cluster set

* Configuration of the recovery destination cluster and tenant

**Procedure**
-----------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery** **>** **Recovery**. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **New Sampling Strategy**.

3. Specify **Sampling Strategy Name**, **Cluster**, and **Sampled At** in the **Sampling Settings** section.

4. Create a recovery tenant: Select a cluster from the drop-down list, enter the tenant name, and configure the zones.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If the version of the selected cluster is V4.0 and later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones. In other words, the number of units that you specify on this page applies to all zones under the new recovery tenant.</p>
