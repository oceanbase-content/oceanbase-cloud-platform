# View restore tasks

This topic describes how to view restore task information.

## Procedure

You can view restore tasks by using the following three methods:

* **Method 1:**

    Log in to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery** > **Recovery**. On the **Recovery Tasks** tab, view the restore task information.

* **Method 2:**

    Log in to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a cluster. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. You can view the restore information of the cluster on the **Recovery Tasks** tab.

* **Method 3:**

    Log in to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a tenant. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. You can view the restore information of the tenant on the **Recovery Tasks** tab.

The procedure of **Method 1** is described as follows:

1. Log in to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation page, choose **Backup & Recovery** \> **Recovery**. The **Recovery** tab automatically appears.

3. On the **Recovery Tasks** tab, view the task information in the following columns: **ID**, **Backup Cluster**, **Backup Tenant**, **Backup Method**, **Destination Cluster**, **Destination Tenant**, **Object to Restore**, **Started At**, **Ended At**, **Status**, and **Actions**. You can filter the restore tasks by status. For more information, see [Initiate a restore task](../1100.backup-and-restoration-functions/700.initiate-a-recovery-task.md) and [Create a sampling strategy for restore](800.regular-recovery/100.create-a-sampling-strategy-for-recovery.md).

    * You can click **Clean Up** in the **Actions** column to release the resources occupied by failed restore tasks.

    * You can click **View Cause** in the **Actions** column to check the causes of the failure.

    * In the upper-right corner of the tab, you can select **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, **Last 7 Days**, or **Last 30 Days**, or select **Custom Time** and specify a time range, to view the tasks in the specified time range.
