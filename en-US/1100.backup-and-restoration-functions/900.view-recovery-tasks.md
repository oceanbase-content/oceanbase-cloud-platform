This section describes how to view restore task information. 

## Procedure

You can view restore tasks by using the following three methods:

* **Method 1**:

* **Method 2**:

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a cluster. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. You can view the restore information of the cluster on the **Recovery Tasks** tab. 

* **Method 3**:

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a tenant. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. You can view the restore information of the tenant on the **Recovery Tasks** tab. 

The procedure of **Method 1** is described as follows: 

1. Log on to the OCP console. 

2. In the left-side navigation page, choose **Backup & Recovery** **\>** **Recovery**. The **Recovery** tab automatically appears.

On the **Recovery Tasks** tab, you can view the task information in the following columns: **ID**, **Backup Cluster**, **Backup Tenant**, **Backup Method**, **Destination Cluster**, **Destination Tenant**, **Object to Restore**, **Started At**, **Restore Duration**, **Status**, and **Actions**. You can filter the restore tasks by status. For more information, see [Initiate a restore task](../1100.backup-and-restoration-functions/700.initiate-a-recovery-task.md) and [Create a sampling strategy for recovery](800.regular-recovery/100.create-a-sampling-strategy-for-recovery.md). 

   * You can click **Clean Up** in the Actions column to release the resources occupied by failed restore tasks. 

   * You can click **View Cause** in the Actions column to check the causes of the failure. 

   * In the upper-right corner of the tab, you can select **Last 1 Hour, Last 24 Hours, Last 7 Days**, or **Last 30 Days**, or select **Custom Time** and specify a time range, to view the tasks in the specified time range.
