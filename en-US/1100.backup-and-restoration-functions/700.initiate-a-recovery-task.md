# Initiate a restore job

You can initiate a restore job for a cluster that has been backed up.

## Prerequisites

* You have backed up the cluster to be restored. For more information, see [Back up now](400.backup-now/100.back-up-cluster-now.md).

* When you restore a physically backed up OceanBase cluster, you cannot restore its data to a cluster of an earlier version.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. Go to the **Initiate Recovery** page by using the following methods:

   * Method 1: Initiate a restore job on the **Recovery** page.

     1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery** > **Recovery**.

     2. On the **Recovery** page, click **Initiate Recovery** in the upper-right corner.

   * Method 2: Initiate a restore job on the O&M page of a cluster.

     1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

     2. Click the name of the target cluster in the **Clusters** list or **Resource Usage** to go to its O&M page.

     3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**.

     4. On the **Backup & Recovery** page of the cluster, click **Initiate Recovery**.

     <p>You cannot restore a cluster by using Method 2 in the following circumstances: <ul><li>The cluster is not in the **Running** state. </li><li>The cluster does not have a backup strategy. </li></ul></p>
     </main>

   * Method 3: Initiate a restore job on the O&M page of a tenant.

      1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the **Tenants** page.

      2. Click the name of the target tenant in the **Tenants** list to go to its O&M page.

      3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**.

      4. On the **Backup & Recovery** page of the tenant, click **Initiate Recovery**.

3. (Optional) If you use Method 1, configure a custom storage configuration or use an existing configuration. If you choose to configure a custom configuration, configure the parameters based on the following tables. If you choose to select an existing configuration, click **Select Existing Configuration**. Then, the system automatically populates the following parameters.

   <p>The following types of clusters cannot be used as the restore destination: <ul><li>Clusters in primary/standby mode: </li><li>Clusters in the Unavailable state </li><li>Clusters of an OceanBase Database version earlier than that of the source cluster </li></ul></p>
   </main>

6. Specify the following zone-related parameters and set the priorities of the zones.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |---------|---|
   | Replica Type    | The type of the replica. Valid values: <ul><li>Full-featured Replica: A general-purpose replica that has a full set of data types and features, including transaction logs, a MemTable, and an SSTable. A full-featured replica can switch to the leader role efficiently to provide services. </li><li>Log Replica: A replica that contains only logs. It has no MemTable or SSTable. It provides log services for external applications and participates in log voting. It can facilitate the restore of other replicas, but it cannot become the leader to provide database services.   </li><li>Read-only Replica: A replica contains full logs, a MemTable, and an SSTable. You can select this type of replica for applications that does not require high consistency in data reading. </li></ul> |
   | Unit Specification | The specifications of the resources that the replica occupies. <ul><li>You can select an existing specification. </li><li>You can also create a specification as needed and select the created specification. </li></ul>  |
