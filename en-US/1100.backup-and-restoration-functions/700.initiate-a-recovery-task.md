# Initiate a recovery task

You can recover a cluster that has a backup.

## Prerequisites

* You have backed up the cluster to be recovered. For more information, see [Back up now](400.backup-now/100.back-up-cluster-now.md).

* You cannot recover data for an OceanBase cluster that has been physically backed up from a later version to an earlier version.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. Go to the **Initiate Recovery** page by using one of the following methods.

   * Method 1: Initiate recovery on the Recovery page.

      1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery** **>** **Recovery**.

      2. On the **Recovery** page, click **Initiate Recovery** in the upper-right corner.

   * Method 2: Initiate recovery on the O&M page of a cluster.

      1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster Overview** page.

      2. Click the target cluster in **Clusters** or **Resource Usage** to go to the O&M page of the cluster.

      3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**.

      4. On the **Backup & Recovery** page of the cluster, click **Initiate Recovery**.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You cannot recover the cluster by using Method 2 in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The cluster is not in the Running state.</li>
    <li>The cluster does not have a backup strategy.
    OCP of this version does not support the recovery of clusters without backup strategies by using Method 2.</li>
    </ul>
    </main>

   * Method 3: Initiate recovery on the O&M page of a tenant.

      1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the **Tenant Overview** page.

      2. Click the target tenant in the **Tenants** list to go to the O&M page of the tenant.

      3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**.

      4. On the **Backup & Recovery** page of the tenant, click **Initiate Recovery**.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You cannot recover the tenant by using Method 3 in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The tenant is not in the Running state.</li>
    <li>The tenant does not have a backup strategy.
    OCP of this version does not support the recovery of clusters without backup strategies by using Method 3.</li>
    </ul>
    </main>

3. (Optional) If you use Method 1, specify the storage configuration fields, or click **Storage Configuration**.

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-----|
   | Storage Type | You can select one of the following media: <ul><li>**File**: Network File System (NFS) media. </li><li> **COS**: Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) is supported only in OceanBase Database V2.2.77 BP2, V4.0, and versions later than V2.2.77 BP2 and earlier than V4.0. </li></ul> |
   | Storage Directory | Select the directory in which the backup files are stored.  <ul><li>You can click **Select Existing Configuration** to automatically populate the following fields: **Domain**, **User**, **AccessKey Pair**, and **Host for Parsing**. </li><li> You can also manually specify the fields.  </li></ul> |
   | Domain | Enter the domain name of the cloud storage of backup files. If you select **COS** in the **Storage Type** field, enter the domain name to access the file stored at COS of Tencent Cloud, for example, `cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com`.  |
  
   | Resource Identity (APPID) | When **Storage Type** is set to **COS**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted. |
   | Project ID | When **Storage Type** is set to **COS**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted. |
   | Project Key | When **Storage Type** is set to **COS**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted. |
   | Host for Parsing | 1. When **Storage Directory** is set to **Select Existing Configuration**, the host for parsing is automatically populated. Otherwise, select a value as prompted.  </br>2. Click **Parse** to obtain the list of clusters that can be recovered.  |

4. Specify the parameters in the **Recovery Source and Time** section by selecting the values from the corresponding drop-down lists.

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------------------------|
   | Source Cluster | If you initiate a recovery task from the O&M page of a cluster, the cluster is the source cluster by default, you do not need to specify this parameter.  |
   | Source Tenant | Select the tenant to recover.  |
   | Recovery Date | Select a date within the specified recoverable time range.  |
   | Recovery Time | Select a point in time within the specified time range.  |

5. Select the destination tenant of the recovery task. Select a cluster in the Running state from the drop-down list and enter the new tenant name.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The following types of clusters cannot be used as the recovery destination:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Clusters in the primary/standby mode.</li>
    <li>Clusters in the Unavailable state.</li>
    </ul>
    </main>

6. Specify the following fields in the Zone Configuration section and set the priorities of the zones.

   | Field | Description |
   |---------|---|
   | Replica Type | Valid values: <ul><li>**Full-featured Replica**: A standard replica type that contains all the data categories and all the features, including MemTables, SSTables, and transaction logs. A full-featured replica can switch to the leader role in an efficient manner to provide services. </li><li>**Log Replica**: A replica that contains only logs. It does not have a MemTable or an SSTable. It provides log services for external applications and participates in log voting. It can facilitate the recovery of other replicas, but it cannot become the leader to provide database services.    </li><li>**Read-only Replica**: A replica that contains full logs, MemTables, and SSTables. You can select this type of replica for applications that does not require high consistency in data reading.  </li></ul> |
   | Unit Specification | The specification of the resources that the replica occupies.  <ul><li>You can select an existing specification or </li><li> create a specification as needed and select the new one.  </li></ul> |
   | Units | The amount of resource units occupied by the replica. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If the version of the destination cluster is V4.0 or later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones. In other words, the number of units that you specify on this page applies to all zones under the recovered tenant. </blockquote> |
