# Initiate a restore task

You can restore a cluster that has a backup. 

## Prerequisites

* You have backed up the cluster to be restored. For more information, see [Back up now](400.backup-now/100.back-up-cluster-now.md). 

* You cannot restore data for an OceanBase cluster that has been physically backed up from a later version to an earlier version. 

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. 

2. Go to the **Initiate Recovery** page by using one of the following methods. 

   * Method 1: Initiate a restore task on the Recovery page. 

      1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery** **>** **Recovery**. 

      2. On the **Recovery** page, click **Initiate Recovery** in the upper-right corner. 

   * Method 2: Initiate a restore task on the O&M page of a cluster. 

      1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster Overview** page. 

      2. Click the target cluster in **Clusters** or **Resource Usage** to go to the O&M page of the cluster. 

      3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. 

      4. On the **Backup & Recovery** page of the cluster, click **Initiate Recovery**. 
      
      <main id="notice" type='explain'> <h4>Note</h4> 
         <p>You cannot restore a cluster by using Method 2 in the following circumstances:<ul><li>The cluster is not in the Running state. </li><li>The cluster does not have a backup strategy. </li></ul></p> 
      </main>

   * Method 3: Initiate a restore task on the O&M page of a tenant. 

      1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the **Tenants** page. 

      2. Click the target tenant in the **Tenants** list to go to the O&M page of the tenant. 

      3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. 

      4. On the **Backup & Recovery** page of the tenant, click **Initiate Recovery**.

3. (Optional) If you use Method 1, specify the storage parameters, or click **Select Existing Configuration**.

   | Storage Class | The type of storage media for backup files. Valid values: <ul><li>**File**: Your local file storage system. Generally, Network File System (NFS) is used. </li><li> **OSS**: Alibaba Cloud OSS is supported only in OceanBase Database V2.2.76 and later.    </li><li> **COS**: Cloud Object Storage (COS) of Tencent Cloud is supported only in OceanBase Database of V2.2.76 and later but earlier than V4.0, or in OceanBase Database V4.2.1 and later.  </li><li> **OBS**: Huawei Cloud Object Storage Service (OBS) is supported only in OceanBase Database V3.2.3.2-105000062022090916 and later but earlier than V4.0.0.0.  </li></ul> |
   | Storage Directory | Select the directory in which the backup files are stored.  <ul><li>You can click **Select Existing Configuration** to automatically populate the following parameters: **Domain**, **User**, **AccessKey Pair**, and **Host for Parsing**. </li><li> You can also manually specify the parameters.  </li></ul> |
   | Domain | Enter the domain name of the cloud storage of backup files. <ul><li>If you select **OSS** for **Storage Type**, enter the domain name that has access to the files stored in Alibaba Cloud OSS, for example, `oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com`. </li><li> If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, enter the domain name that has access to the files stored in the COS bucket of Tencent Cloud, for example, `cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com`. </li><li> If you select **OBS** for **Storage Type**, enter the domain name that has access to the files stored in OBS of Huawei Cloud, for example, `obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com`. </li></ul> |
   | User | This parameter is displayed only when **Storage Type** is set to OSS. It is the user used to access the cloud storage of backup files.  |
   | AccessKey Pair | This parameter is displayed only when **Storage Type** is set to OSS. It is the AccessKey used to access the cloud storage of backup files.  |
   | Resource Identity (APPID) | When **Storage Type** is set to COS, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |
   | Project ID | When **Storage Type** is set to COS, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |
   | Project Key | When **Storage Type** is set to COS, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |
   | Host for Parsing | 1. When **Storage Directory** is set to **Select Existing Configuration**, the host for parsing is automatically populated. Otherwise, select a value as prompted.  </br>2. Click **Parse** to obtain the list of clusters that can be restored.  |

4. Specify the parameters in the **Recovery Source and Time** section by selecting the values from the corresponding drop-down lists. 

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>   <h4>Note</h4>   <p>By default, the tenant is restored. In OceanBase Database V2.2.77 and later but earlier than V4.0.0.0, you can restore tables in the tenant when you restore the tenant. </p>   </main>

   * Restore a tenant

      | Parameter | Description |
      |-------|-------------------------------|

      | Recovery Date | Select a date within the specified recoverable time range.  |
      | Restore Point in Time | Select a point in time within the specified time range.  |

      If you use Method 3 to restore a tenant, you can restore tables in the tenant. 

      | Parameter | Description |
      |-------|-------------------------------|
      | Source Cluster | The source cluster to restore the table. The default value is the cluster to which the current tenant belongs.  |
      | Source Tenant | The source tenant to restore the table. The default value is the current tenant.  |
      | Recovery Date | Select a date within the specified recoverable time range.  |
      | Restore Point in Time | Select a point in time within the specified time range.  |
      | Restore Table Object | Select the tables to be restored in the source object list on the left and click **>** to add them to the target object list.  |

5. Select the destination tenant of the restore task. Select a cluster in the Running state from the drop-down list and enter the new tenant name. 

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>   <h4>Note</h4>   <p>The following types of clusters cannot be used as the restore destination:<ul><li>Clusters in the primary/standby mode. </li><li>Clusters in the Unavailable state. </li><li>Clusters of an OceanBase Database version earlier than that of the source cluster. </li></ul></p>   </main>

6. Specify the following zone-related parameters and set the priorities of the zones. 

   | Parameter | Description |
   |---------|---|
   | Replica Type | Valid values: <ul><li>Full-featured Replica: A standard replica type that contains all the data categories and all the features, including MemTables, SSTables, and transaction logs. A full-featured replica can switch to the leader role efficiently to provide services. </li><li> Log Replica: A replica that contains only logs. It does not have a MemTable or an SSTable. It provides log services for external applications and participates in log voting. It can facilitate the restore of other replicas, but it cannot become the leader to provide database services.    </li><li> Read-only Replica: A replica that contains full logs, MemTables, and SSTables. You can select this type of replica for applications that does not require high consistency in data reading.  </li></ul> |
   | Unit Specification | The specification of the resources that the replica occupies.  <ul><li>You can select an existing specification or </li><li> create a specification as needed and select the new one.  </li></ul> |
   | Units | The amount of resource units occupied by the replica. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If the version of the destination cluster is V4.0 or later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones. In other words, the number of units that you specify on this page applies to all zones under the restored tenant. </blockquote> |
