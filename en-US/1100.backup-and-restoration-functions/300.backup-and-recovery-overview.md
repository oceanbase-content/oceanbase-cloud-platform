# Backup and recovery overview

On the Overview page, you can view the core metrics and alerts of backup and restoration, backup storage trends, and information about clusters that have or have not been backed up. You can also go to the corresponding pages to initiate restoration tasks and immediate backup tasks, create backup policies and restoration sampling policies, and launch the backup and restoration wizard.

## Core metrics

In the Core Metrics section, you can view **Clusters with Backup Policies, Weekly Data Backup Success Rate, Objects with Log Backup Latency** , and **Weekly Successful Restoration Sampling Tasks** .

## Alerts

In the Alerts section, you can filter alerts by time range.

## Backup storage trends

In the Backup Storage Trends section, you can select a time range to view the backup storage trends from the perspective of **Total Volume, Data Backup** , and **Log Backup** . You can filter the chart by time or cluster to view the backup storage tendency chart in a specific time range. You can also move the pointer over a specific points in time on the curve to view the backup storage data.

## Cluster Backed Up

The Clusters Backed Up tab displays the number of backed up clusters in the tab name. The table on this tab contains the following columns: **Cluster Name, Last Data Backup, Last Log Backup Time, Log Latency** , **Status** , and **Actions** .

* When OceanBase is V4.0 and above, display the tenants with backup data and the clusters they belong to (including manual and automatic scheduled backups).
* When OceanBase is below V4.0, display the clusters with backup data (including manual and automatic scheduled backups).
