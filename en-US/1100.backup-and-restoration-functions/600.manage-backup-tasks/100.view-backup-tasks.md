# View backup tasks

This topic describes how to filter data backup tasks, log backup tasks, and cleanup tasks of regular backups by time, and how to start or stop a task.

## Procedure

You can view backup data by using the following three methods:

* **Method 1**:

   Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery > Backup**. On the **Backup Tasks** tab, view the backup task information.

* **Method 2**:

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a cluster. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. You can view the backup information of the cluster on the **Data Backup** tab.

* **Method 3**:

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a tenant. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. You can view the backup information of the tenant on the **Data Backup** tab.

The procedure of **Method 1** is described as follows:

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery > Backup**. By default, the **Backup Tasks** tab automatically appears.

3. View data backup tasks.

   On the **Data Backup** tab, you can view information about data backup tasks in the following columns: **ID**, **Cluster**, **Tenant**, **Data Backup Method**, **Backup Set ID**, **Started At**, **Ended At**, **Restorable Time Point**, **Second Backup**, **Status**, and **Actions**. You can also filter the data backup tasks by status. The following table describes more information.

   In the upper-right corner of the tab, you can select **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, **Last 7 Days**, or **Last 30 Days**, or select **Custom Time** and specify a time range, to filter the data backup tasks.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   | --- | --- |
   | ID | Click the plus sign (**+**) on the right of the ID to view **Backup Method**, **Data Version**, and **Storage Directory**.  |
   | Cluster | Click the cluster name in the **Cluster** column. The **Overview** page of the cluster appears. You can search for clusters.  |
   | Tenant | Click the tenant name in the **Tenant** column to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.  |
   | Data Backup Method | Valid values: **Full** and **Incremental**.  |
   | Backup Set ID | The ID of the full backup set. The ID is used to identify the relationship between the full data backups and incremental data backups in physical backup mode. A full backup matches an incremental backup of the same full backup set ID.  |
   | Started At | The backup start time.  |
   | Ended At | The backup end time.  |
   | Restorable Time Point | The point in time to which the backup set can be restored.  |
   | Second Backup | If the value is **Yes**, you can click **Yes** to view all secondary backup tasks for the data.  |
   | Status | Valid values: **Starting**, **Initializing**, **In Progress**, **Failed**, and **Completed**. You can filter backup tasks by status. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If the cluster is of OceanBase Database V2.2.77 or later but earlier than V4.0, you can view the task progress in percentage. </blockquote> |
   | Actions | If the data backup task fails, click **View Cause** in the **Actions** column.  |

4. View log backup tasks.

   On the **Log Backup** tab, you can view information about log backup tasks in the following columns: **Cluster, Tenant, Backup Method, Host IP Address, Last Backed up At, Latency, Storage Directory,** **Started At**, **Status**, and **Actions**. You can also filter the log backup tasks by status. The following table describes more information.

   In the upper-right corner of the tab, you can select **Last 1 Hour, Last 24 Hours, Last 7 Days, or Last 30 Days**, or select **Custom Time** and specify a time range, to filter the log backup tasks.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   | --- | --- |
   | Cluster | Click the cluster name in the **Cluster** column. The **Overview** page of the cluster appears. You can search for clusters.  |
   | Tenant | The tenant whose logs are backed up.  |
   | Backup Method | The backup method of the cluster. Valid values: **Logical Backup** and **Physical Backup**.  |
   | Host IP Address | The IP address of the host.  |
   | Last Backed up At | The point in time of the latest log backup.  |
   | Latency (s) | The time difference between the backup data and the real-time data, in seconds.  |
   | Storage Directory | The directory where backup files are stored.  |
   | Started At | The backup start time.  |
   | Status | Valid values: **Starting**, **In Progress**, **Stopping**, **Stopped**, **Failed**, and **Interrupted**. You can filter backup tasks by status.  |
   | Actions | For a cluster in **Starting** or **In Progress** state, this column provides the **Stop** option. For a cluster in **Stopped** state, this column provides the **Start** option. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If a backup strategy has been enabled when you attempt to stop log backup, you can disable the backup strategy to disable log backup. If you retain the current backup strategy or manually initiate data backup, log backup will be enabled by default. </blockquote> |

5. View backup cleanup tasks.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You can clean up only logical backups. Logical backup is supported in OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V2.2.60. </p>
    </main>

   On the **Backup Cleanup** tab, you can view information about backup cleanup tasks in the following columns: **ID**, **Cluster, Started At, Ended At**, and **Status**. You can also filter the backup cleanup tasks by status. A backup cleanup task can be in any of the following states: **SUCCESSFUL**, **RUNNING**, **FAILED**, and **ABORTED**.

   In the upper-right corner of the tab, you can select **Last 1 Hour, Last 24 Hours, Last 7 Days**, or **Last 30 Days**, or select **Custom Time** and specify a time range, to filter the cleanup tasks by time.
