Back up cluster now
================================

This topic describes how to back up a cluster immediately.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* A cluster in logical backup mode supports only full backup. A cluster in physical backup mode supports both full backup and incremental backup.

* The OceanBase cluster is not in **upgrading** state.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

You can back up cluster now by using one of the following methods.

* Method 1:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery > Backups**.

   3. On the **Backups** page, click **Back up Now** in the upper-right corner of the page and choose **Back Up Cluster** from the drop-down list.

* Method 2:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster Overview** page.

   3. Click the target cluster in **Clusters** or **Resource Usage** to go to the O&M page of the cluster.

   4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**.

   5. On the **Backup & Recovery** page of the cluster, click **Backup Now**.

The following takes **Method 1** as an example.

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup \& Recovery** **\>** **Backup** . Then, click **Back up Now** in the upper-right corner of the page and choose **Back Up Cluster** from the drop-down list.

3. Select the objects that you want to back up.

   Select the objects from the **Backup Cluster** drop-down list. The system automatically identifies **OceanBase Version** and **Backup Method** of the cluster and automatically populates the fields of **Storage Configuration** .

   If **Backup Mode** of the cluster is logical backup, you must first install the backup service. For more information, see [Install a service](../1000.manage-backup-and-recovery-service/200.installation-services.md).

4. Specify Storage Configuration.

   * If the cluster that you want to back up has a backup strategy, the fields in the Storage Configuration section are automatically populated.

   * Otherwise, you must manually specify the values. You can specify the values as prompted or by following the instructions of **Create Cluster-level Backup Strategy** in [Create a cluster-level backup strategy](../500.regular-backup/100.manage-cluster-backup-strategy/100.create-a-cluster-backup-strategy.md).

     After you specify the values, click **Test** .

5. Select a data backup mode.

   For physical backup, select a data backup mode. For logical backup, only full backup is supported.

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>For physical backup, you must perform a full backup before you can perform an incremental backup. Otherwise, the following error message is returned in the <code>Check if ready to data backup</code> step: Full data backup needed before incremental data backup.</li>
    <li>If the error message &quot;Cluster compaction needed before full data backup&quot; is returned in the <code>Start cluster compact if necessary</code> step of a full backup, <a href="../../600.cluster-functions/1100.manage-cluster-merge/200.cluster-perform-merge.md">Perform a major compaction</a> and click <strong>Retry</strong> .</li>
    </ul>
    </main>

6. Click **Back up Now** .
