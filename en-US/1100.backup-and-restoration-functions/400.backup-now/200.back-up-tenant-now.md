# Back up a tenant now

This topic describes how to back up a tenant immediately.

## Prerequisites

Tenant backup is supported only in OceanBase Database V3.2.2-20220304134610 and later.

## Procedure

You can back up a tenant immediately by using one of the following methods.

* **Method 1:**

    Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery** > **Backups**. On the **Backups** page, click **Back up Now** in the upper-right corner of the page and choose **Back Up Tenant** from the drop-down list.

* **Method 2:**

    Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a tenant. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. Then, click **Back up Now**.

The procedure of **Method 1** is described as follows:

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery** > **Backups**. On the **Backups** page, click **Back up Now** in the upper-right corner of the page and choose **Back Up Tenant** from the drop-down list.

3. Select the object that you want to back up.

   Select the object that you want to back up from the **Backup Tenant** drop-down list. The system automatically identifies **OceanBase Version** and **Backup Method** of the tenant and automatically populates the fields of **Storage Configuration**.

4. Specify **Storage Configuration**.

   * If the tenant that you want to back up has a backup strategy, the fields in the **Storage Configuration** section are automatically populated.

   * Otherwise, you must manually specify the configuration. You can specify the configuration as prompted or by following the instructions of step 4 in [Create a tenant-level backup strategy](../500.regular-backup/200.manage-tenant-backup-strategy/100.creat-a-tenant-backup-stategy.md).

     Then, click **Test**.

5. Select a data backup method.

   For physical backup, select a data backup method. For logical backup, only full backup is supported.

    <ul>
    <li>For physical backup, you must perform a full backup before you can perform an incremental backup. Otherwise, the following error message is returned in the <code>Check if ready to data backup</code> step: &quot;full data backup needed before incremental data backup.&quot;</li>
    <li>If the error message &quot;Cluster compaction needed before full data backup&quot; is returned in the <code>Start cluster compact if necessary</code> step of a full backup, <a href="../../600.cluster-functions/1100.manage-cluster-merge/200.cluster-perform-merge.md">perform a major compaction</a> and click <strong>Retry</strong>. </li>
    </ul>
    </main>
