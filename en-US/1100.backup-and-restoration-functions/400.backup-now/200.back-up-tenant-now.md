Back up tenant now
================================

This topic describes how to back up a tenant immediately.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

Tenant backup is supported only in OceanBase V3.2.2-20220304134610 and later.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

You can back up tenant now by using one of the following methods.

* Method 1:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery > Backups**.

   3. On the **Backups** page, click **Back up Now** in the upper-right corner of the page and choose **Back Up Tenant** from the drop-down list.

* Method 2:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the **Tenants** page.

   3. Click the target cluster in **Tenants** to go to the O&M page of the cluster.

   4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**.

   5. On the **Backup & Recovery** page of the cluster, click **Backup Now**.

The following takes **Method 1** as an example.

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup \& Recovery** **\>** **Backup** . Then, click **Back up Now** in the upper-right corner of the page and choose **Back Up Tenant** from the drop-down list.

3. Select the objects that you want to back up.

   Select the objects from the **Backup Cluster** drop-down list. The system automatically identifies **OceanBase Version** and **Backup Method** of the tenant and automatically populates the fields of **Storage Configuration** .

4. Specify Storage Configuration.

   * If the tenant that you want to back up has a backup strategy, the fields in the Storage Configuration section are automatically populated.

   * Otherwise, you must manually specify the values. You can specify the values as prompted or by following the instructions of **Create Tenant-level Backup Strategy** in [Create a tenant-level backup strategy](../500.regular-backup/100.manage-cluster-backup-strategy/100.create-a-cluster-backup-strategy.md).

     After you specify the values, click **Test** .
