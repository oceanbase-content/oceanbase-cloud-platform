# Upgrade the version of a service

This topic describes how to upgrade the version of a backup or recovery service that is already installed.

## Prerequisite

You have installed a backup or recovery service. For more information, see [Install a service](../1000.manage-backup-and-recovery-service/200.installation-services.md).

## Procedure

1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup \& Recovery** **\>** **Service** .

2. Find the service whose version you want to upgrade and click **Upgrade Version** in the Actions column.

   The **Upgrade Version** dialog box appears.

3. Select the version to upgrade to.

   Click **Add Version** to upload the RPM package of the target version. If the target version is already in the list, you can select it without uploading the package.

    <p>Only packages higher than the current service version can be selected, and the software package of the target version in the <strong>Upgrade Version</strong> dialog box must match the hardware architecture of the host where the service whose version you want to upgrade is located.</p>
    </main>

   * For a host running on the x86 architecture, select a software package that ends with .x86_64.rpm.

   * For a host running on the ARM architecture, select a software package that ends with .aarch64.rpm.
