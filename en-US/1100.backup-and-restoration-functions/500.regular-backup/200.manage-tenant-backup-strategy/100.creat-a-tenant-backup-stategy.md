# Create a tenant-level backup strategy

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to configure personalized backup and restore strategies based on the tenant dimension. After you create a tenant-level backup strategy for a tenant, the tenant is no longer affected by the cluster-level backup strategy.

<p>If a cluster-level backup strategy exists in the cluster to which the tenant belongs, the cluster-level backup strategy content is populated by default when you create a tenant-level backup strategy. </p>

## Prerequisites

You can create backup strategies only for tenants of a cluster of OceanBase Database V4.0.0 or later.
