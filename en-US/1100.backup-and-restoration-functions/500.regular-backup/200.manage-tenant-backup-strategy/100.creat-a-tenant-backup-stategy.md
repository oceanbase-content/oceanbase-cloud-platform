# Create a tenant-level backup strategy

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to configure personalized backup and restore strategies based on the tenant dimension. After you create a tenant-level backup strategy for a tenant, the tenant is no longer affected by the cluster-level backup strategy. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>If a cluster-level backup strategy exists in the cluster to which the tenant belongs, the cluster-level backup strategy content is populated by default when you create a tenant-level backup strategy. </p></main>

## Prerequisites

* You can create backup strategies only for tenants of a cluster of OceanBase Database V4.0.0 or later. 

* If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V4.0.0 or later, second backup is disabled by default. To enable this feature, change the value of the `ocp.backup.advanced-secondary-backup.enable` parameter to `true` in **System Parameters**. 

* If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V4.0.0 or later, ensure that the following requirements are met before you configure second backup:

   * The storage medium for both regular backup and second backup is Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS). 
   * The retention period of second backup files is shorter than that of regular backup files. 
   * If the backup scheduling cycle is weekly, the retention period of second backup files must be greater than or equal to 7 days. If the backup scheduling cycle is monthly, the retention period of second backup files must be greater than or equal to 30 days. 
   * Regular backup files and second backup files cannot be stored in the same bucket. In addition, you cannot specify a custom storage path for second backup files. 
   * The AccessKey pair of a regular backup task must have the permissions for cross-region replication. Otherwise, the task cannot be scheduled. If the task fails to be executed, you can retry the task after you configure the permissions. 
   * The bucket for regular backup cannot be configured with cross-region replication rules. Otherwise, the task cannot be scheduled. If the task fails to be executed, you can retry the task after you delete these rules. 
   * If the destination of a second backup task is an independently deployed OSS bucket, you must configure the `cloudName` and `cloudLocation` fields of the OSS bucket in the `ocp.backup.advanced-secondary-backup.target-cloud-name` and `ocp.backup.advanced-secondary-backup.target-cloud-location` parameters respectively in **System Parameters**. 

## Procedure

You can create a tenant-level backup strategy by using the following two methods:

* **Method 1**

   Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery > Backup**. Then, you can create a tenant-level backup strategy on the **Backup** page. 

* **Method 2**

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a cluster. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. Then, you can create a tenant-level backup strategy on the **Backup & Recovery** page. 

The procedure of **Method 1** is described as follows: 

1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery > Backup**. 

2. On the **Backup** page, move the pointer over **New Backup Strategy** and select **Create Tenant-level Backup Strategy**. 

3. Select the tenant to back up from the drop-down list. 

   * For a cluster of a version earlier than OceanBase Database V2.2.60, **logical backup** is used. 

   * For a cluster of OceanBase Database V2.2.60 and later, **physical backup** is used. 

4. Specify the following storage configuration parameters and click **Test**. 

   * For logical backup, select the storage configuration configured during [service installation](../../1000.manage-backup-and-recovery-service/200.installation-services.md). 

      If no backup service is installed, you must first install the backup service. For more information, see [Install a service](../../1000.manage-backup-and-recovery-service/200.installation-services.md). 

   * For physical backup, specify fields described in the following table. 

      | Parameter | Description |
      |-----|---|
      | Storage Configuration Name | You can configure a custom configuration or select an existing configuration.  <ul><li>For a custom configuration, specify the following fields. </li><li> If you select an existing configuration, click **Select Existing Configuration**. Then, the system automatically populates the following fields. </li></ul> |
      | Storage Class | The type of storage media for backup files. Valid values: <ul><li>**File**: Your local file storage system. Generally, Network File System (NFS) is used. </li><li> **OSS**: Alibaba Cloud OSS is supported only in OceanBase Database V2.2.76 and later.    </li><li> **COS**: Cloud Object Storage (COS) of Tencent Cloud is supported only in OceanBase Database of V2.2.76 and later but earlier than V4.0, or in OceanBase Database V4.2.1 and later.  </li><li> **OBS**: Huawei Cloud Object Storage Service (OBS) is supported only in OceanBase Database V3.2.3.2-105000062022090916 and later but earlier than V4.0.0.0.  </li></ul> |
      | Storage Directory | The directory in which the backup files are stored on the media.   <blockquote>**Notice**</br>If you have configured a backup strategy for the cluster to which the tenant belongs, we recommend that you specify the same storage directory as that of the cluster. Otherwise, the backup statistics of the tenant will be affected. </blockquote> |
      | Alert Threshold for Backup Storage Capacity | The threshold for backup storage capacity alerts. This parameter is displayed if you select **File** for **Storage Type**. The default threshold is 80%.  |
      | Domain | Enter the domain name of the cloud storage of backup files. <ul><li>If you select **OSS** for **Storage Type**, enter the domain name that has access to the files stored in Alibaba Cloud OSS, for example, `oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com`. </li><li> If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, enter the domain name that has access to the files stored in the COS bucket of Tencent Cloud, for example, `cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com`. </li><li> If you select **OBS** for **Storage Type**, enter the domain name that has access to the files stored in OBS of Huawei Cloud, for example, `obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com`. </li></ul> |
      | User | If you select **OSS** for **Storage Type**, enter the user that has access to the files stored in Alibaba Cloud OSS.  |
      | AccessKey Pair | If you select **OSS** for **Storage Type**, enter the AccessKey that has access to the files stored in Alibaba Cloud OSS.  |
      | Resource Identity (APPID) | If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |
      | Project ID | If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |
      | Project Key | If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |

5. Specify fields in the **Scheduling Settings** section. 

   * **Scheduling Cycle**: If you set the scheduling cycle to **Month**, you can select at most 10 days. 

   * If you need to perform physical backups, log backup must be enabled.
