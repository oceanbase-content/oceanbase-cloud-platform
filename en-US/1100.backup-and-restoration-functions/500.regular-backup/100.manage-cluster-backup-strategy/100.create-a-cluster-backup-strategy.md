# Create a cluster-level backup strategy

A cluster-level backup strategy takes effect only on tenants that do not have a tenant-level backup strategy. You can configure a cluster-level backup strategy for the unified management of those tenants.

## Prerequisites

* If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V4.0.0 or later, second backup is disabled by default. To enable this feature, change the value of the `ocp.backup.advanced-secondary-backup.enable` parameter to `true` in **System Parameters**.

* If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V4.0.0 or later, ensure that the following requirements are met before you configure second backup:

  * The storage medium for both regular backup and second backup is Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS).
  * The retention period of second backup files is shorter than that of regular backup files.
  * If the backup scheduling cycle is weekly, the retention period of second backup files must be greater than or equal to 7 days. If the backup scheduling cycle is monthly, the retention period of second backup files must be greater than or equal to 30 days.
  * Regular backup files and second backup files cannot be stored in the same bucket. In addition, you cannot specify a custom storage path for second backup files.
  * The AccessKey pair of a regular backup task must have the permissions for cross-region replication. Otherwise, the task cannot be scheduled. If the task fails to be executed, you can retry the task after you configure the permissions.
  * The bucket for regular backup cannot be configured with cross-region replication rules. Otherwise, the task cannot be scheduled. If the task fails to be executed, you can retry the task after you delete these rules.
  * If the destination of a second backup task is an independently deployed OSS bucket, you must configure the `cloudName` and `cloudLocation` fields of the OSS bucket in the `ocp.backup.advanced-secondary-backup.target-cloud-name` and `ocp.backup.advanced-secondary-backup.target-cloud-location` parameters respectively in **System Parameters**.

## Procedure

You can create a cluster-level backup strategy by using the following three methods:

* **Method 1**

   Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery > Backup**. In the upper-right corner of the page that appears, click **Create Backup Strategy** and select **Create Cluster-level Backup Strategy** from the drop-down list.

* **Method 2**

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a cluster. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. Then, click **Create Cluster-level Backup Strategy**.

* **Method 3**:

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Overview** page of a tenant. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup & Recovery**. Then, click **Create Cluster-level Backup Strategy**.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>You can use <b>Method 3</b> only if the tenant and the cluster do not have a backup strategy. </p>

</main>

The following procedure takes **Method 1** as an example.

1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup and Recovery** \> **Backup**.

2. On the **Backup** page, move the pointer over **Create Backup Strategy** and click **Create Cluster-level Backup Strategy**.

3. Select the cluster to back up from the drop-down list.

   * For a cluster of a version earlier than OceanBase Database V2.2.60, **logical backup** is used.

   * For a cluster of OceanBase Database V2.2.60 and later, **physical backup** is used.

4. Specify the following storage configuration parameters and click **Test**.

   * For logical backup, select the storage configuration configured during [service installation](../../1000.manage-backup-and-recovery-service/200.installation-services.md).

      If no backup service is installed, you must first install the backup service. For more information, see [Install a service](../../1000.manage-backup-and-recovery-service/200.installation-services.md).

   * For physical backup, specify fields described in the following table.

      | Parameter | Note |
      |-----|---|
      | Storage Configuration Name | You can configure a custom configuration or select an existing configuration.  <ul><li>For a custom configuration, specify the following fields. </li><li> If you select an existing configuration, click **Select Existing Configuration**. Then, the system automatically populates the following fields. </li></ul> |
      | Storage Type | The type of storage media for backup files. Valid values: <ul><li>**File**: Your local file storage system. Generally, Network File System (NFS) is used. </li><li> **OSS**: Alibaba Cloud OSS is supported only in OceanBase Database V2.2.76 and later.    </li><li> **COS**: Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) is supported only in OceanBase Database V2.2.76 and later but earlier than V4.0.  </li></ul> |
      | Storage Directory | The directory in which the backup files are stored on the media.  |
      | Alert Threshold for Backup Storage Capacity | The threshold for backup storage capacity alerts. This parameter is displayed if you select **File** for **Storage Type**. The default threshold is 80%.  |
      | Domain | Enter the domain name of the cloud storage of backup files. <ul><li>If you select **OSS** for **Storage Type**, enter the domain name that has access to the files stored in Alibaba Cloud OSS. You can add a port number after a domain name, for example, `oss.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com:8080`. </li><li> If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, enter the domain name that is used to access the objects in the Tencent Cloud COS bucket. In this case, you cannot add a port number after the domain name. </li></ul> |
      | User | If you select **OSS** for **Storage Type**, enter the user that has access to the files stored in Alibaba Cloud OSS.  |
      | AccessKey Pair | If you select **OSS** for **Storage Type**, enter the AccessKey that has access to the files stored in Alibaba Cloud OSS.  |
      | Resource Identity (APPID) | If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |
      | Project ID | If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |
      | Project Key | If you select **COS** for **Storage Type**, move the pointer over the question mark (**?**)  and specify the value as prompted.  |

5. Specify fields in the **Scheduling Settings** section.

   * **Scheduling Cycle**: If you set the scheduling cycle to **Month**, you can select at most 10 days.

   * If you need to perform physical backups, log backup must be enabled.

6. Schedule the clearing of expired backup files.

7. Specify alert thresholds. You can specify the timeout threshold for data backup tasks, alert threshold for log backup delays, and alert threshold for the number of days without successful data backup. After you set a threshold, an alert is triggered when the threshold is reached.

8. Optional. Configure second backup settings.

   To back up the backup data files and log files to another directory, turn on **Second Backup**.
