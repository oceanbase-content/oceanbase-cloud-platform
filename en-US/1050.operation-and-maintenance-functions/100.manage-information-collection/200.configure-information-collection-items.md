# Configure information collection items

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides built-in information collection items. An information collection item is a source that triggers information collection. You can disable unwanted collection items as needed.

If a collection item is enabled, OCP automatically collects information about the corresponding event and generates a collection report. If a collection item is disabled, the system no longer automatically collects information when the corresponding event occurs.
