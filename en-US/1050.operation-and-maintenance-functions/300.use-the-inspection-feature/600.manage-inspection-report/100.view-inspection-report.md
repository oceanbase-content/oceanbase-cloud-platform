## Related operations

OCP allows you to periodically clear historical inspection reports by using system parameters:

1. The `ocp.inspection.report.expired.cleanup.enabled` parameter specifies whether to clear the expired inspection reports. The default value is `false`. If you set the value to `true`, OCP automatically clears all inspection reports that were generated the specified number of days before, which is specified in the `ocp.inspection.report.expired.days` parameter.

2. The `ocp.inspection.report.expired.days` parameter specifies the number of days after which an inspection report expires. The default value is 15 days. If you enable the automatic cleanup feature, OCP clears all expired inspection reports except the standardized host check reports at 00:00 every day.
