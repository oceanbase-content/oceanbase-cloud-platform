# Modify the configuration file

Before you install OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition, you must modify the configuration file.

## Prerequisites

* The `ocp-4.0.0-ce.tar.gz` software package is obtained. For more information, see [Prepare for the installation](4.installation-preparation.md).
* The address in the file cannot be 127.0.0.1, localhost, or a host name.
* If the central control server is accessible from both public and private IP addresses, we recommended that you configure a private IP address to increase the file transmission speed.
* You have applied for and bound a virtual IP address (VIP) if it is needed.

## Procedure

1. Upload the `ocp-4.0.0-ce.tar.gz` package to any directory of the central control server and decompress it. The package contains the following files:
   * `ocp_installer.sh`: the OCP installation script.
   * `ocp.tar.gz`: the OCP image file.
   * `ocp-installer.tar.gz`: the OCP installer image file.
   * `config.yaml`: the OCP configuration file.

2. Modify the `config.yaml` file.
   You need to modify the following configurations in the configuration file based on your actual deployment environment:
   * MetaDB configurations
   * Secure Shell (SSH) authentication configurations
   * OCP configurations
   * Other configurations

   ```bash

   # # In a precheck, the resources and environment of the host are checked to make sure that the central control server meets the deployment requirements. We do not recommend that you skip the precheck. However, if the host resources are limited or you deploy OCP for a test, you can skip the precheck.
   precheck_ignore: false

   # MetaDB configurations.
   # If you set the create_metadb_cluster parameter to true, a separate OceanBase cluster is created as the OCP MetaDB.
   create_metadb_cluster: false

   # You can use the clean_metadb_cluster parameter to specify whether to delete the OCP MetaDB when OCP is uninstalled. If this parameter is not specified, the system makes the decision based on the value of the create_metadb_cluster parameter.
   clean_metadb_cluster: false

   # Configurations of the OCP MetaDB
   ob_cluster:
       name: obcluster
       home_path: /home/admin/oceanbase
       root_password: '******'
       # The data storage directory. We recommend that you set a dedicated data storage directory.
       data_path: /data/1
       # The directory of clogs, ilogs, and slogs. We recommend that you set a dedicated log directory.
       redo_path: /data/log1
       sql_port: 2881
       rpc_port: 2882
       # All zones of the OCP MetaDB.
       zones:
           # The zone name.
         - name: zone1
           # All servers in the zone.
           servers:
             - 192.168.0.1
        ## Other custom parameters for deploying OceanBase clusters, the following is a list of commonly used parameters. If you need to add other parameters, you can add the corresponding `key` `value` configuration
         # custom_config:
         #   - key: devname
         #     value: eth0
         #   - key: cpu_count
         #     value: 0

         #     value: 5368709120
         #   - key: datafile_maxsize
         #     value: 0
         #   - key: datafile_next
         #     value: 0
