# os_cpu_irq_error

## Description

This alert is triggered when software interrupts have been executed on a CPU for more than 1 minute. Software interrupts should be distributed to multiple CPUs for execution, to prevent a single CPU from being exclusively occupied.

## Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Metric | cpu_softirq_per_cpu, cpu_idle_per_cpu |
| Source | The metrics are basic host monitoring metrics collected by node_exporter. </br>cpu_softirq_per_cpu is equivalent to Cpu-si (percentage of CPU time spent handling software interrupts) in the top command output and cpu_idle_per_cpu is equivalent to Cpu-id (percentage of CPU time spent idle) in the top command output. |
| Collected metric | node_cpu_seconds_total_native |
| Metric expression | <li>cpu_softirq_per_cpu: 100 \*sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total_native{mode="softirq", @LABELS}[@INTERVAL]))</li><li>cpu_idle_per_cpu:100* sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total_native{mode="idle", @LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) </li> |
| Collection cycle | 1 second |

## Alert rule

| Metric expression | Metric description | Default threshold (unit: percentage) | Detection cycle | Elimination cycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cpu_softirq_per_cpu > 3 and cpu_idle_per_cpu < 6 | <li>cpu_softirq_per_cpu: the percentage of time spent handling software interrupts on a CPU.</li><li>cpu_idle_per_cpu: the percentage of time spent idle on a CPU.</li> | <li>cpu_softirq_per_cpu: 3% </li><li>cpu_idle_per_cpu: 6%</li> | 10 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

| Trigger method | Alert level | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical | Server |

## Alert templates

* **Overview**
  * Template: \${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
  * Example: svr_ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:cpu=3 os_cpu_irq_error
* **Details**
  * Template: Cluster: \${ob_cluster_name}, host: \${svr_ip}, alert: \${alarm_name}, CPU \${cpu}, percentage of CPU time spent handling software interrupts \${cpu_softirq_per_cpu_value_zh_cn}, percentage of CPU time spent idle \${cpu_idle_per_cpu_value_zh_cn}.
  * Example: Cluster: obcluster, host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, alert: os_cpu_irq_error, CPU 3, percentage of CPU time spent handling software interrupts 100%, percentage of CPU time spent idle 0%.

## Impact on the system

Interrupts are divided into hardware interrupts and software interrupts.

Software interrupts include TIMER, NET_RX, NET_TX, TASKLET, SCHED, RCU, and others. Common software interrupts occur during network packet receiving and transmission. Software interrupts may increase CPU utilization.

## Possible causes

Check for the following possible causes:

1. Invalid network requests. If a server is offline but traffic is still forwarded to the server, a large number of network packet receiving interrupts occur.
2. Network attacks, such as a SYN flood attack.

### Suggested solutions

1. Check for changes in /proc/softirqs to identify the interrupt.

   ```yaml
   watch -n 5 'cat /proc/softirqs'
   ```

2. For a network interrupt, use System Activity Reporter (Sar) or tcpdump for further analysis.
