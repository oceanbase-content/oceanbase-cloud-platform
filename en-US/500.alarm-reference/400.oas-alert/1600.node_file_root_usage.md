# node_file_root_usage

## Description

This alert is triggered when the disk usage of the root directory on the host exceeds 95%. 

## Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Metric | root_disk_usage |
| Source | This metric is a basic host monitoring metric collected by node_exporter. </br>You can run `df -B1` to view the disk usage of each directory. |
| Collected metric | node_filesystem_avail_bytes, node_filesystem_size_bytes |
| Metric expression | 100 *(1 - avg(node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/",@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS) / avg(node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint="/",@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS)) |
| Collection cycle | 1 second |

## Alert rule

| Metric expression | Metric description | Default threshold (unit: percentage) | Detection cycle | Elimination cycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| root_disk_usage > 95 | The disk usage of the root directory. | 95% | 10 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

| Trigger method | Alert level | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical | Server |

## Alert templates

* Overview
   * Template: \${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
   * Example: svr_ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx node_file_root_usage
* Details
   * Template: Cluster: \${ob_cluster_name}, host: \${svr_ip}, alert: \${alarm_name}, root directory usage \${value_shown} exceeds ${alarm_threshold}%. 
   * Example: Cluster: obcluster, host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, alert: node_file_root_usage, root directory usage 96.844% exceeds 95%. 

## Impact on the system

Generally, no files but only built-in system directories such as `/bin`, `/etc`, `/tmp`, and `/var` are placed under the root directory. If the root directory is full, the system may fail to properly run. 

### Possible causes

* The root partition is too small. 
* Log files occupy excessive space. 
* Space occupied by zombie processes is not released. 

## Suggested solutions

1. View the usage of the root directory and check whether the alert is triggered because the root partition is too small. 

   ```yaml
   df -h
   ```

2. View the space occupied by files and delete invalid files. 

   ```yaml
   ## Access the target directory.
   cd /target-path
   ## View the directory size.
   du -h -x --max-depth=1
   ## Delete invalid files.
   rm -rf invalid-files
   ```

3. Check whether any zombie processes occupy space. 

   ```yaml
   ## Check for zombie processes.
   lsof | grep deleted
   ## Delete zombie processes.
   lsof | grep deleted | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   ```
