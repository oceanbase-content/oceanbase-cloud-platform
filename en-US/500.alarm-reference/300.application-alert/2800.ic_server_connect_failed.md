ic_server_connect_failed Inter-Connector
=============================================

**Description**
------------------------------------

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) needs to manage OceanBase clusters in multiple virtual private clouds (VPCs) in multi-VPC mode. OCP accesses the services in these VPCs through secure channels established by IC-Servers and IC-Agents. An IC-Server provides a virtual IP (VIP) address for OCP and functions as the proxy for OCP to access other VPCs.

This alert is triggered when the IC-Server cannot be connected.

Principle
------------------------------

The following table describes the key parameters that are involved in the monitoring and alerting logic.

|     Parameter     |                                                                                    Value                                                                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Metric            | ic_server_health <blockquote>**Note** <br> The result returned by the health check interface. When the value is 0, the IC-Server cannot be connected. </blockquote>                      |
| Source            | The interface for health check on an IC-Server. The URL of the interface is in the format of http:// **IP** :8088/ok. Replace IP with the IP address of the monitored host. |
| Collected metric  | ic_server_health                                                                                                                                                            |
| Metric expression | min(ic_server_health{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS)                                                                                                                               |
| Collection cycle  | 1 minute                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Alert rule**
-----------------------------------

|      Metric      | Default threshold | Duration  | Alert cycle | Elimination cycle |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| ic_server_health | 0                 | 0 seconds | 60 seconds  | 5 minutes         |

**Alert information**
------------------------------------------

|            Trigger method             | Alert level | Scope  |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical    | Server |

**Alert templates**
----------------------------------------

* Overview: ${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}

* Details: OCP node ${ocp_address} cannot connect to IC-Server ${ic_server_address}.

* Overview example: xxx.xxx.xxx.1 IC-Server connection failed

* Details example: OCP node xxx.xxx.xxx.1 cannot connect to IC-Server xxx.xxx.xxx.2.

**Impact on the system**
---------------------------------------------

You cannot manage OceanBase clusters and resources of other VPCs in the OCP console.

**Possible causes**
----------------------------------------

* An error occurs on the host where an IC-Server is installed. As a result, the IC-Server cannot be connected.

* OCP cannot connect to specific IC-Servers due to network issues.

**Suggested solutions**
--------------------------------------------

1. Log on to the host where the disconnected IC-Server is installed to check whether the process related to the IC-Server is normal and whether errors are printed in the logs.

   1. Log on to the IC-Server host.

      * If you fail to log on to the host, troubleshoot and fix the errors until the logon succeeds.

      * If you can log on to the host, go to the next step.

   2. Run the following command to check whether the ic-server process is normal.

      ```sql
      ps -ef|grep ic-server
      ```

      * If the process is not started, run the `supervisord restart ic-server` command to restart the command.

      * If the process is started, go to the next step.

   3. Run the following command to check whether errors are printed in the log file `~/logs/ic-server/server.log` of the IC-Server.

      ```sql
      grep -r "error"  
      ~/logs/ic-server/server.log
      ```

      Replace `~` with the actual deployment path of the IC-Server.
      * If error logs are printed, perform troubleshooting based on the errors.

      * If no error logs are printed, go to the next step.

2. Check whether OCP cannot connect to specific IC-Servers due to network issues.

   For more information, see [Network troubleshooting](../500.appendix/600.network-troubleshooting.md).

3. Contact technical support for troubleshooting if the alert is not eliminated after all the preceding measures are taken.
