# ob_host_task_timeout

## Description

This alert is triggered when it takes over three hours to execute a task in an OBServer. The following task type is supported:

DELETE_SERVER (task_type): a task to delete a server.

## Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Metric | ob_server_task_max_duration_seconds |
| Source | Internal views. SQL statements for metric collection: ```SELECT job_type as task_type, TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, START_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) as max_sys_task_duration_seconds, svr_ip FROM DBA_OB_SERVER_JOBS WHERE job_status='INPROGRESS'``` |
| Collected metric | ob_server_task_max_duration_seconds |
| Metric expression | max(ob_server_task_max_duration_seconds{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS) |
| Collection cycle | 1 minute |

## Alert rule

| Metric expression | Metric description | Default threshold (unit: s) | Detection cycle | Time before clearance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ob_server_task_max_duration_seconds > 10800 | The timeout duration for the execution of a task in an OBServer. | 10800 (3 hours) | 60 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

| Trigger method | Alert level | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical | Tenant |

## Alert templates

* Alert overview: ${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
* Alert details: Cluster: ${ob_cluster_name}. Host: ${host} (zone: ${obzone}). Alert: A task in the OBServer has timed out. Task Type: ${task_type}. Execution Time: ${value_shown}, which exceeds the threshold of ${alarm_threshold} seconds.
* Overview example: ob_cluster=C1-1000:tenant_name=T1. A task in the OBServer timed out.
* Details example: Cluster: C1. Host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (zone: Z1). Alert: A task in the OBServer has timed out. Task Type: DELETE_SERVER. Execution Time: 4 hours, which exceeds the threshold of 10800 seconds.

## Impact on the system

* A prolonged task execution period affects task scheduling in OceanBase Database, which reduces the task processing throughput.
* Prolonged occupation of resources affects the system stability.

## Possible causes

None.
