# ob_tenant_compaction_error

## Description

OceanBase Database V4.0 and later support major compactions of a tenant. If an error occurs during the major compaction of a tenant, this alert is triggered.

## Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Metric | compaction_is_error |
| Source | Internal views. SQL statements for metric collection: ```select tenant_id, case is_error when 'YES' then 1 else 0 end as is_error from CDB_OB_MAJOR_COMPACTION``` |
| Collected metric | ob_compaction_is_error |
| Metric expression | max(ob_compaction_is_error{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS) |
| Collection cycle | 1 minute |

## Alert rule

| Metric expression | Metric description | Default threshold | Detection cycle | Time before clearance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| compaction_is_error == 1 | <li>1: An error occurred during the major compaction of a tenant.</li><li> 0: No error occurred during the major compaction of a tenant.</li> | 1 | 60 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

| Trigger method | Alert level | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical | Tenant |

## Alert templates

* Alert overview: ${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
* Alert details: Cluster: ${ob_cluster_name}. Tenant: ${tenant_name}. Alert: ${alarm_name}
* Overview example: ob_cluster=C1-1000:tenant_name=T1. An error occurred during the major compaction of the OceanBase Database tenant.
* Details example: Cluster: obcluster. Tenant: T1. Alert: An error occurred during the major compaction of the OceanBase Database tenant.

## Impact on the system

Replicas of the OceanBase cluster are inconsistent. For example, data in the replicas is inconsistent, or data in the index table is inconsistent with that in the primary table.

## Possible causes

Technically, only some extreme cases may cause this error.
