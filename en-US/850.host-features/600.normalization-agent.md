# Perform host standardization checks

Database clusters are the cornerstone of data. The performance and stability of database clusters are crucial for a production environment. To ensure the full play of the value of database clusters, we recommend that you perform standardization checks on hosts and fix possible risks before you deploy the database clusters.

This topic describes how to perform host standardization checks. For more information about the host check items, see [Host standardization check items](../850.host-features/700.host-standardized-inspection-scope.md).

## Prerequisites

The host is in the **Idle** state.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Hosts**.

3. On the **Hosts** page, find the entry to host standardization based on the actual business scenario.

   * If a new host is in the **Idle** state and you have completed host standardization for the host or you have clicked **Do not remind me again** in the prompt in the **Status** column, you can click the **...** icon in the **Actions** column and select **Host Standardization**.

   * When a new host is in the **Idle** state and standardization has not been performed for the host, hover the pointer over the ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/410/%E7%A9%BA%E9%97%B2%E5%9B%BE%E6%A0%87.png) icon in the **Status** column of the host. In the prompt that appears, click **Host Standardization**.

4. Select the type of operation to perform on the host and click **OK**.

   * **Check & Auto Repair**: The system checks the host and automatically fixes the risks found in the check.
      * Click **View Repair Report** to view the detailed risk details. If risks persist, manually fix the risks based on the information in the report.

      * After the risks are fixed, click **Recheck** to recheck the host.

   * Check Only: The system only checks the host and will not automatically fix the risks found in the check.
      * After the check task is completed, click **View Check Report** to view the detailed check results.

      * If the check report contains risks that can be automatically fixed, click **Auto Repair**. The system automatically fixes the risks.
      * For risks that cannot be automatically fixed, fix them manually according to the information in the report.
      * After the risks are fixed, click **Recheck** to recheck the host.
