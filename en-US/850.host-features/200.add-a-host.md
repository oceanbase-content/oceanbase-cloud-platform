# Add a host

This topic describes how to add a host to OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) to add your offline resources to the OCP console.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on with an account that has host management permissions.

* If you want to specify the installation directory and port of OCP-Agent, modify the following parameters. For more information, see [Manage system parameters](../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-system-parameter/100.view-system-parameters.md).

  * `ocp.agent.home.path.prefix`: specifies the installation directory of OCP-Agent.
  * `ocp.agent.manager.http.port`/`ocp.agent.monitor.http.port`: specifies the port of OCP-Agent.

   Before you add a host, you must wait about 3 minutes after the parameters are modified for the modifications to take effect.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Hosts**.

3. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Add Host**.

4. Enter the IP address and SSH port number. Enter the IPv4 address of the new host. The SSH port number is 22 by default.

5. Select the host type. If the list does not include the corresponding host type, click **Create Host Type** to create a host type on OCP.

   A host type is a label assigned by the user for hosts of the same configurations. We recommend that you use a meaningful name for easier management of your hosts.

6. Select the IDC. If the list does not include the corresponding IDC, you can click **Create IDC** to create an IDC on OCP.

   * The region means the geographical region where the host is located. One physical region can have one or more physical IDCs.

   * The region and IDC are referenced in OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing strategies. Specify the actual region and IDC.

7. Select the host type, and set the connection credentials and alias for the host.

   | Parameter | Description   |
   |--------|----------|
   | Host Type | The type of the host to be added. Valid values: **Physical Machine**, **Container**, and **ECS**.     |
   | Port Mapping | Indicates the mapping relationship between OCP-Agent and the host and between OCP-Exporter and the host in the following format: `<host port>:<OCP-Agent port in docker>, and <host port>:<OCP-Exporter port 1 in docker>`. This parameter is required when the host type is set to **Container**.    |
   | Credentials | Select the credential in the password box. If no credential is available, click **Add Credential** in the drop-down list to create a connection credential for the host.  <br><ul><li>**Credential Name**: The credential name must start with a letter and end with a letter or a digit. It can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_). It must be 2 to 32 characters in length. </li><li>**Authorization Type**: The authorization type of the credential. Valid values: **Username/Password** and **SSH Private Key**. </li><li>**User Type**: The user type of the credential. SSH users with root permissions are supported. A regular user with root permissions must first be granted the permission to run sudo commands without a password. OCP allows you to grant the permission to run all sudo commands without a password by adding `username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` to the `sudoers` file in the `/etc` directory. </li></ul> |
   | Host Alias | The alias of the host. This parameter is optional.     |
