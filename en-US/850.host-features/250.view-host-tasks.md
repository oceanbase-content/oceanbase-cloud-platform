# View the details of tasks on a host

This topic describes how to view the details of O&M tasks on a host.

## Prerequisites

The host is in the **Maintaining** state. A host is in the **Maintaining** state when you restart or reinstall OCP-Agent, or delete the host. For more information, see [Restart OCP-Agent](400.restart-the-ocp-agent.md), and [Reinstall OCP Agent](500.reinstall-ocp-agent.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Hosts**.

3. Find the target host and click **View Task** in the **Actions** column.

4. In the dialog box that appears, view the information about the task that is in progress on the host, and click the task ID to go to the task details page. On the task details page, you can perform operations such as viewing task logs, rolling back the task, and retrying the task. For more information, see [Manage tasks](../1600.system-management-features/100.manage-tasks.md).
