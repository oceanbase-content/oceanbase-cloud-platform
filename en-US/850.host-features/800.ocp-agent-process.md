# OCP-Agent processes

This topic describes OCP-Agent processes.

## OCP-Agent processes

| Process name | Feature | Start-stop method |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ocp_agentd | Serves as the daemon process of the OCP-Agent service.  | It automatically starts when the OCP-Agent service starts and cannot be stopped.  |
| ocp_mgragent | Executes the O&M commands issued by OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) and completes various O&M operations on the host.  | It automatically starts when the OCP-Agent service starts and cannot be stopped.  |
| ocp_monagent | Collects the monitoring data required by OCP.  | It automatically starts when the OCP-Agent service starts and cannot be stopped.  |

## Automatic startup of OCP-Agent processes upon power-on

OCP supports automatic startup of OCP-Agent processes upon power-on in this version. When the server is restarted, the OCP-Agent processes are automatically started. When the OCP-Agent RPM package is installed, the RPM script writes `ocp_agent.service` to the systemd configuration to implement automatic startup of OCP-Agent processes upon power-on.

```Json
[Unit]
Description=start ocp_agent
[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=${ocp.agent.home.path}/bin/ocp_agentctl start
ExecStop=${ocp.agent.home.path}/bin/ocp_agentctl stop
ExecReload=${ocp.agent.home.path}/bin/ocp_agentctl restart
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The `ocp.agent.home.path` parameter is replaced with the actual path during installation.

## Manually start OCP-Agent processes

If you need to start OCP-Agent processes on a CLI, you can use the `start` command in the help script.

## Related service processes

The following tabl e describes the service processes that are automatically started with the ocp-agent process when the server is restarted.

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>If you have configured automatic startup scripts for the obproxy and observer processes on the server, we recommend that you remove the scripts or optimize the scripts to improve their compatibility to avoid configuration conflicts. </p>
