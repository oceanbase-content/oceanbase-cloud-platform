# Host management operations

If you are assigned with the role of system administrator, host manager (HOST_MANAGER), or host read-only viewer (HOST_VIEWER), you can click **Hosts** in the left-side navigation pane go to the **Hosts** page.

## View hosts

The **Hosts** list displays the information of each host in columns such as **IP Address**, **Tag**, **SSH Port**, **Host Category**, **IDC**, **Cluster**, **Service**, and **Status**.

* You can also search for hosts by page, and by host IP address, host name, or cluster name. You can search for multiple hosts at a time by specifying their IP addresses separated with spaces.
* Hover the pointer over the **Tag** field of a host to view all tags of the host. You can click the Edit icon to manage the tags. For more information, see [Manage Tags](../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-tags/100.tags-overview.md).
* You can filter hosts by using the **Host Category**, **IDC**, **Service**, and **Status** columns.
* When a host is in the **Maintaining** state, you can click **View Task** in the **Actions** column to go to the task details page of the cluster. On the task details page, you can perform operations such as viewing task logs, rolling back a task, and retrying a task. For more information, see [Manage tasks](../1600.system-management-features/600.manage-tasks.md).
* Click the host IP address to view basic information, OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Agent information, and monitoring data of the host. For more information, see [View details of a host](150.view-a-host-overview.md).
* You can click the name of a cluster to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster and view its details.

You can also click the **+** icon next to a host to view the detailed information about the host, such as **Host ID, Host Name, Port Mapping, Host Type, OCP Agent Version, Operating System, CPU Architecture, CPU Model, CPU Cores**, and **Description**.

| Cluster | The cluster where the host resides, including the OceanBase cluster and the OBProxy cluster. You can click the name of a cluster to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.  |
| Host Category | Physical hosts, container hosts, and Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service (ECS) hosts are supported.<li>You can deploy multiple services of different types on a physical host. Do not deploy multiple services of the same type on the same physical host; otherwise, conflicts may arise. </li><li> You can deploy only one type of service on a container host. We recommend that you do not deploy an OceanBase cluster on a container host.  </li> |
| Status | The status of the host. Valid values: Newly Submitted, Idle, Online, Offline, and Deleting.  |
| Port Mapping | The mapping relationship between OCP-Agent and the host and between the ocp_exporter process and the host in the following format: `<host port>:<OCP-Agent port in docker>`, and `<host port>:<ocp_exporter port 1 in docker>`.  |
