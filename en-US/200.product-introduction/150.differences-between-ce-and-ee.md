# Differences between the features of OCP Enterprise Edition and OCP Community Edition

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) is available in two editions: OCP Enterprise Edition and OCP Community Edition.

* OCP Enterprise Edition is an enterprise-level database management platform intended for the management of OceanBase Database. The platform provides full-lifecycle management for OceanBase clusters, OceanBase Database tenants, and OceanBase Proxy (OBProxy) clusters. It also provides a wide range of observability services such as monitoring, alerting, logging, and SQL diagnostics, as well as enterprise-level services such as backup and restore, inspection, full link tracking, autonomy service, and high-availability redundancy architecture based on two IDCs. It allows you to manage OceanBase clusters in an efficient and reliable manner, thereby reducing IT O&M costs.

* OCP Community Edition: oriented for community users with OceanBase Database management requirements. The platform provides routine O&M management for all components of OceanBase Database Community Edition, including host management, OceanBase cluster management, OceanBase Database tenant management, OBProxy cluster management, and backup and restore. It also supports a variety of monitoring, alerting, and logging features. Moreover, OCP Community Edition provides open APIs and powerful ecosystem interconnection capabilities, meeting custom business requirements of enterprises and individuals.
