# Feature differences between OCP Enterprise Edition and OCP Community Edition

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) is available in two editions: Enterprise Edition and Community Edition.

* OCP Enterprise Edition is an enterprise-level database management platform intended for the management of OceanBase Database. The platform provides full-lifecycle management for OceanBase clusters, OceanBase Database tenants, and OceanBase Proxy (OBProxy) clusters. It also provides a wide range of observability services such as monitoring, alerting, logging, and SQL diagnostics, as well as enterprise-level services such as backup and restore, inspection, end-to-end tracing, autonomy service, and high-availability redundancy architecture based on two IDCs. It allows you to manage OceanBase clusters in an efficient and reliable manner, thereby reducing IT O&M costs.

* OCP Community Edition is oriented for community users with OceanBase Database management requirements. The platform provides routine O&M management for all components of OceanBase Database Community Edition, including host management, OceanBase cluster management, OceanBase Database tenant management, OBProxy cluster management, and backup and restore. It also supports a variety of monitoring, alerting, and logging features. Moreover, OCP Community Edition provides open APIs and powerful ecosystem interconnection capabilities to meet the custom business requirements of enterprises and individuals.

The following table lists the feature support of OCP Enterprise Edition and OCP Community Edition.
