# Create a standalone centralized database

The standalone centralized mode is a streamlined database architecture of OceanBase Database. Compared with a distributed cluster, a standalone centralized database requires only one host and is easy to deploy and ready to use. This topic describes how to create a standalone centralized database.

## Background information

The standalone centralized architecture supports only one data replica, which means data loss may occur when storage or hardware fails. We recommend that you regularly back up critical business systems or configure high availability (HA) solutions, such as tenant-level primary/standby databases and multi-replica disaster recovery, to avoid single points of failure.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console with an account that has the permission to create clusters.

* Only OceanBase Database V4.1.0 and later support this deployment mode.

* When you create an OceanBase cluster, the cgroup feature is enabled by default to enhance CPU and IOPS isolation. If your business involves a single tenant and less than 14 CPU cores and requires high database performance, we recommend that you set the `enable_cgroup` parameter to `false` to disable the cgroup feature. In addition, if the operating system kernel version on the host is earlier than V4.1.9, you cannot create tenants in the cluster. In this case, disable the cgroup feature.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console, and click **Clusters** in the left-side navigation pane to go to the **Clusters** page. Find the entry to cluster creation based on the actual business scenario.

   1. If you do not have a manageable cluster, the system displays a message on the **Clusters** tab, prompting you to create one. Click **Create Cluster** in the message.

   2. If you already have a manageable cluster, go to the **Clusters** tab and then click **Create Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

2. In the **Create Cluster** dialog box, select **Standalone Centralized**.

3. Set the basic information of the cluster.

    The following table describes the parameters in the **Basic Settings** section.

     | Parameter | Description |
     |-----|-------|
     | **Cluster Name** | The name of the cluster to be created. The cluster name must be 2 to 48 characters in length and can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_). The cluster name must start with letters. |
     | **root@sys Password** | This password can be customized or randomly generated. The password must meet the following complexity requirements: <ul><li>It must be 8 to 32 characters in length.</li><li>It must contain characters of at least three of the following types: digits (0 to 9), uppercase letters (A to Z), lowercase letters (a to z), and special characters. Supported special characters are <code>~ ! @ # % ^ & * _ - + = \| ( ) { } [ ] : ; , . ? /</code>.  </li></ul> |
     | **OceanBase Database Version** | You can select an OceanBase Database version from the drop-down list or click **Add Version** at the bottom of the list to upload an OceanBase Database version.  |
     | **Zone Name** | You can retain the default name or define a custom name. A zone name must consist of 2 to 48 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_), and start with a letter. In an OceanBase cluster that consists of multiple zones, the cluster must have a zone that shares the same region as that of the primary zone.  |
     | **Host** | Select a host that has the same architecture as that of the selected OceanBase Database version. The selected host runs both the observer and rootserver processes. If no host is available in the drop-down list, you can click **Add Host** in the drop-down list to add a host.   |

4. Enable **Parameter Settings** and specify related cluster parameters.

   You can adjust the CPU, memory, data disk, and log disk capacities at the cluster level by specifying the following parameters: <code>cpu_count</code> (default value: automatically adjusted), <code>memory_limit_percentage</code> (default value: 80%), <code>system_memory</code> (default value: 30GiB), <code>data_disk_usage_limit_percentage</code> (default value: 90%), <code>datafile_size</code>, <code>clog_disk_usage_limit_percentage</code> (default value: 90%), and <code>log_disk_size</code>. For more information about the parameters, see <a href="https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000640281">Overview</a>.

    * You can click the button in section ① of the following figure to add startup parameters one by one and set their values.

    * You can also click **Select Parameter Template** as shown in section ② of the following figure and then select a parameter template. The system will automatically populate parameters in this section by using the template. If no cluster parameter template is available, you can click **Create Cluster Template** to create one. For more information, see [Manage cluster parameter templates](../1200.cluster-parameters-template-management.md).

         The system provides five built-in templates that contain general parameters. You can use a template for cluster configuration. The following table describes the built-in templates.

         | Template | Parameter settings | Description |
         |------|------|-------|
         | Default Parameter Template for HTAP | `large_query_threshold:600s` | Suitable for hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) workloads. You can use it to quickly get insights from campaign operation data, fraud detection, and scenario-specific recommendations. <br>This template applies to OceanBase Database V4.3.0 and later. |
         | Default Parameter Template for OLAP | `enable_record_trace_log:false`<br>`large_query_threshold:0ms`<br>`trance_log_slow_query_watermark:7d` | Suitable for real-time data warehouse analytics. <br>This template applies to OceanBase Database V4.3.0 and later.   |
         | Default Parameter Template for COMPLEX_OLTP | `large_query_threshold:600s` | Suitable for workloads such as banking and insurance systems. These workloads often involve complex join operations, complex subqueries, batch processing jobs compiled in PL, long-running transactions, and large transactions. Short-running queries are sometimes executed in parallel. <br>This template applies to OceanBase Database V4.3.0 and later.   |
         | Default Parameter Template for KV | `large_query_threshold:0ms` | Suitable for workloads involving a high throughput and are sensitive to latency, such as key-value workloads and wide-column workloads of an HBase database. <br>This template applies to OceanBase Database V4.3.0 and later.   |
         | Default Parameter Template for OceanBase Database V2.2.77 | `clog_sync_time_warn_threshold:1s`<br>`enable_merge_by_turn:FALSE`<br>`enable_one_phase_commit:FALSE`<br>`freeze_trigger_percentage:50`<br>`max_kept_major_version_number:1`<br>`minor_freeze_times:150`<br>`resource_soft_limit:100` | We recommend that you use this template for a production cluster of OceanBase Database V2.2.77.   |

5. Enable **Custom Settings** to configure paths and ports.

   * Configure the paths:
      1. In the **Path Settings** section, specify **Software Installation Path**, **Data Disk Path**, and **Log Disk Path** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the paths can be used. If a path cannot be used, you can perform troubleshooting based on the test results, or use another path.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>In a production environment, we recommend that the size of the log disk be at least three times that of the memory size of the host. To avoid performance issues, we recommend that you do not create the data directory and the log directory on the same disk. </p>
      </main>

   * Configure the ports:
      1. In the **Port Settings** section, specify **SQL Port** and **RPC Port** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the ports are occupied. If a port is occupied, you must use another port.

6. After the test succeeds, click **Submit**.

7. Confirm the information in the right-side panel, and click **OK**.

8. In the **Note** dialog box, specify whether to create a user tenant.

    * If you do not need to create a tenant, click **Skip**. In this case, only the cluster is created. For more information about how to create a user tenant, see [Create a tenant](../../500.quickstart/600.quickstart-create-a-tenant.md).
    * If you need to create a tenant, set the tenant mode and tenant name. After the configuration is complete, click **Create and Submit**. You can view the task progress in **Task Center**.

      The following table describes the parameters.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |-----|-------|
      | Tenant Mode | The mode of the tenant. Default value: **MySQL**. |
      | Tenant Name | The name of the tenant, which is the same as the tenant mode by default. You can use a custom name instead.  |
