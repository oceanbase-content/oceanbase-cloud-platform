# Create a distributed cluster

OceanBase Database provides an enterprise-level native distributed architecture, which allows you to deploy OceanBase Database in distributed cluster mode. A distributed cluster provides financial-grade high availability and smooth scaling capabilities. It is highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL databases and is suitable for core business systems that demand high data security.

You can create distributed clusters in primary/standby mode based on your business needs.

<h4>Applicability</h4>
<p>OceanBase Cloud Platform Community Edition only support create primary clusters. </p>
</main>

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console with an account that has the permission to create clusters.

* (Optional) If you are creating a multi-replica OceanBase cluster, you need to have an available OBProxy cluster in the current OCP. For information about how to create an OBProxy cluster, see the following topics:

  * [Create an OBProxy cluster](../../800.obproxy-functions/200.create-an-obproxy-cluster.md)

  * [Take over an OBProxy](../../800.obproxy-functions/400.manage-a-obproxy-server/200.take-over-an-obproxy.md)

* You can create a standby cluster only for a primary cluster in the running state. The OceanBase Database version must be between V2.2.50 and V4.0.0.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   * If you do not have a manageable cluster, the system displays a message on the **Clusters** page, prompting you to create one. Click **Create Cluster** in the prompt.

   * If you already have a manageable cluster, go to the **Clusters** page, and then click **Create Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Create Cluster** page, select **Distributed Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

3. Set the basic information of the cluster.

   * **Create a primary cluster**
