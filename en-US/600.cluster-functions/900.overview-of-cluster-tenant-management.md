# Overview of cluster tenant management

You can view the tenants, the resource distribution information of all tenants, and monitoring data of the top 5 tenants in the cluster that you manage.

## Prerequisites

You have all permissions on the cluster and the management permissions on its tenants.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenant Management** to go to the **Tenant Management** page.

5. Click **Create Tenant** to create a tenant for the cluster. For more information, see [Create a tenant](../500.quickstart/600.quickstart-create-a-tenant.md).

6. View the resource distribution information in the **Capacity Usage Overview** module.

   The resource distribution information includes the CPU utilization, memory usage, and data disk usage of each tenant in percentage, as well as the remaining CPU, memory, and data disk resources of the system in percentage.

   When you move the pointer over a tenant in a pie chart, the chart displays the specific resource usage of the tenant. You can also click **View Usage Trends** in the upper-right corner of **Data disk** to view the data disk usage trend within a specified period of time.

8. In the **Top 5 Tenants** section, view the performance metrics of the top 5 tenants by workload, such as the QPS, TPS, SQL response time, transaction response time, number of sessions, event waiting_count, event waiting_time, capacity_tables, and capacity_partitions. You can also view the monitoring information during the last hour, day, or week as needed.

   | TPS | The average number of transactions processed per second. | v$sysstat |
   | SQL response time | The SQL response time, in µs. | v$sysstat |
   | Transaction response time | The average time taken by the server to process a transaction, in µs. | v$sysstat |
   | Sessions | The number of active sessions and the number of current sessions. | __all_virtual_processlist |
   | Event waiting_count | The average number of wait events per second. | v$system_event |
   | Event waiting_time | The average wait time of each wait event, in μs. | v$system_event |
   | Capacity_tables | The number of tables. | gv$table |
   | Capacity_partitions | The number of partitions. | v$partition |
