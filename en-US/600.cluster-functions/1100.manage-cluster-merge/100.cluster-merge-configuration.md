# Modify the major compaction settings of a cluster

You can configure custom strategies for minor compactions and daily major compactions of a cluster as needed.
A cluster-level strategy takes effect on all tenants in the cluster. For more information about how to configure different minor and major compaction strategies for each tenant in a cluster, see [Modify major compaction settings of a tenant](../../700.tenant-functions/1400.manage-tenant-merge/200.details-of-tenant-major-compaction.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management**.

4. Click the **Configuration for Major Compaction** tab.

5. Configure the major compaction strategies.

   1. In the upper-right corner of the **Major Compaction Strategy** section, click **Modify**.

   2. Hover the pointer over the ![Image 17.png](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/8048190061/p168332.png "Image 17.png") icon of a parameter and configure the major compaction strategy as prompted.

   3. After you configure the strategy, click **Save**.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If the major compaction speed is slow, you can appropriately increase the value of <strong>Merge task weight</strong>. However, this decreases the weights of other running tasks in OceanBase Database, such as backup and recovery tasks. Therefore, when multiple tasks are running in OceanBase Database at the same time, you need to determine whether to modify the weight of the major compaction task based on task priorities.</p>

6. Configure the minor compaction strategy.

   1. In the upper-right corner of the **Minor Compaction Strategy** section, click **Modify**.

   2. Hover the pointer over the ![Image 17.png](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/8048190061/p168332.png "Image 17.png") icon of a parameter and configure the minor compaction strategy as prompted.

   3. After you configure the strategy, click **Save**.

    <p>The modified cluster-level strategy overwrites inconsistent strategies of all tenants in the cluster. Proceed with caution.</p>
