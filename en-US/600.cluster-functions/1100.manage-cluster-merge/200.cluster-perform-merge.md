# Perform a major compaction

You can immediately trigger a major compaction for a cluster in the idle state. When an error occurs during the major compaction of the cluster, you can perform troubleshooting to clear the error, and then continue with the major compaction.

## Prerequisites

* Cluster-level major compactions are no longer supported in OceanBase Database V4.0 and later. You can initiate a major compaction only for a primary tenant in a cluster. The major compaction for a standby tenant is automatically triggered after the standby tenant synchronizes the major compaction status of the primary tenant. You cannot manually initiate a major compaction for a standby tenant.

* The `enable_manual_merge` parameter specifies whether to enable manual major compactions. If the cluster version is between OceanBase Database V1.x and V3.x, make sure that the `enable_manual_merge` parameter is set to `False` on the page that appears after you choose **Clusters > Parameter Management**. Alternatively, if `enable_manual_merge` is set to `True`, manually perform a major compaction by using SQL statements. For more information, see [Manually control a major compaction](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-database-cn-0000000001417800).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management**.

5. On the **Details of Major Compaction** tab, view the major compaction information in the **Basic Information** section.

6. After you confirm that the cluster is in the **Idle** state, click **Initiate Major Compaction**. The system will initiate a major compaction for all tenants in the cluster.

   After a major compaction is initiated, the major compaction progress is displayed next to **Status**.

7. If the status is **Tenant major compaction in progress**, you can click **View Tenants** to view the tenants that are in the progress of the major compaction.

8. When an error occurs during the major compaction of the tenants, you can click **View Tenants** to locate the faulty tenant.
   After you perform troubleshooting, click **Clear Exceptions** to clear the error flag and continue the major compaction.
