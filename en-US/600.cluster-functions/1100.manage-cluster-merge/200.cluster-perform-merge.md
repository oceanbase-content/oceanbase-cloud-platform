# Perform a major compaction

You can immediately trigger a major compaction for a cluster in the idle state. When an error occurs during the major compaction of the cluster, you can perform troubleshooting, clear the error, and then continue the major compaction.

## Prerequisites

The `enable_manual_merge` parameter specifies whether to enable manual major compactions. If the cluster version is between OceanBase Database V1.x and V3.x, make sure that the `enable_manual_merge` parameter is set to `False` on the page that appears after you choose **Clusters > Parameter Management**. Alternatively, if `enable_manual_merge` is set to `True`, manually perform a major compaction by using SQL statements. For more information, see [Manually control a major compaction](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-database-en-10000000000963946).

## Trigger a major compaction

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management**.

5. On the **Details of Major Compaction** tab, view the major compaction information in the **Basic Information** section.

6. After you confirm that the cluster is in the **Idle** state, click **Initiate Major Compaction**. The system will initiate a major compaction for all tenants in the cluster.

   After a major compaction is initiated, the major compaction progress is displayed next to **Status**.

7. If the status is **Tenant major compaction in progress**, you can click **View Tenants** to view the tenants that are in the progress of the major compaction.

8. When an error occurs during the major compaction of the tenants, you can click **View Tenants** to locate the faulty tenant.
   After you perform troubleshooting, click **Clear Exceptions** to clear the error flag and continue the major compaction.
