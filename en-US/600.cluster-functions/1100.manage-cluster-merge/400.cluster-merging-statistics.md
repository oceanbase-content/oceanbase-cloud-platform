# View statistics of a major compaction

This topic describes how to view the statistics of a major compaction.

## Procedure

1. Log in to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Overview** page.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management**.

5. In the **Last 3 Major Freezes** section of the **Details of Major Compaction** tab, view the statistics of the major compactions.

   The statistics provide the following two statistical graphs for the last three major compactions:

   * Top 5 Tenants by Average Minor Compactions

   * Top 5 Tenants by Peak Memory Usage Before Major Compaction

   The major compaction time and performance data helps you learn the health of the OceanBase cluster because major compactions affect the overall performance of the cluster. In most cases, daily major compactions are expected to run at the specified point in time. If the number of minor compactions and memory usage exceed the specified thresholds, a major compaction is triggered in a cluster. You can determine whether the resources allocated to a tenant are sufficient by observing the metrics of the tenant. You can upgrade the resource specifications of a tenant to avoid major compactions in a cluster triggered by insufficient resources.
