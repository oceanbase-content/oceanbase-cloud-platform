# Add a zone

You can add zones to a cluster that you manage.

## Prerequisites

* You have the permission to update the target OceanBase cluster in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

* The target OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

  Otherwise, you need to take over the OceanBase cluster to the current OCP cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../300.manage-a-cluster/400.take-over-a-cluster.md).

* You cannot add a zone to a **standalone centralized** database.
  
## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Clusters** page, find the target OceanBase cluster and click its name.

4. Go to the **Overview** page of the cluster and click **Create Zone** in the upper-right corner.

5. In the dialog box that appears, specify the zone information.

   By default, only one zone is added. You can click **+NewZone** to add more zones.

   The following table describes the parameters required for setting the zone information.

   |    **Parameter**     | **Description** |
   |---------|------|
   | Zone Name | The name of the zone.      |
   | IDC      | The IDC where the zone is located.    |
   | Model     | Optional. If you select a model, the host list is filtered based on the model. |
   | CPU Architecture  | The CPU architecture of the zone. Valid values: `aarch64` and `x86`. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>You can select a CPU architecture only if the OceanBase Database RPM package for this architecture is available. </p></main>    |
   | Software Package Type  | The type of the software installation package of the OceanBase cluster. If the system cannot identify the software installation package type of the OceanBase cluster, you need to select an appropriate installation package based on the version of your operating system. |
   | Host      | The IP address of the host. You can select multiple IP addresses. In a production environment, we recommend that the size of the log disk be at least three times the memory size of the host. To avoid performance issues, we recommend that you do not create the data directory and the log directory on the same disk. |
   | Custom Settings  | The OS user, path, and port number of the OBServer node. For more information, see the section about custom settings in [Create a distributed cluster](../200.create-a-cluster/100.create-a-distributed-cluster.md).    |
   | Parameter Settings | The startup parameters of all OBServer nodes in the zone. For more information about parameters, see [Overview](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001375595). <br>If you do not specify the OBServer node startup parameters, the startup parameters specified when you created the cluster are used.    |

6. Click **OK**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress. You can also view the task progress in **Task Center**.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the zone is displayed as **Running** in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page of the cluster, the zone is created.
