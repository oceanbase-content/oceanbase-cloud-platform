# Edit a zone

This topic describes how to modify the region or IDC setting of a zone. The modification applies to the region or IDC attribute of all hosts in the zone. Proceed with caution.

## Prerequisites

* You have the privilege to update the target OceanBase cluster.

* The target OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster. Otherwise, you need to take over the OceanBase cluster to the current OCP cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../300.manage-a-cluster/400.take-over-a-cluster.md).

* The OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V3.x or later.

* The zone to be edited is in the **Running** state.
  
## Procedure

1. Log in to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the **Zones** list, click **Edit** in the **Actions** column of the target zone.

5. In the dialog box that appears, select a new region and IDC for the zone, and then click **OK**.
