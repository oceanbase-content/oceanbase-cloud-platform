# Stop a zone

This topic describes how to stop a zone. Stopping a zone also stops all OBServer nodes in the zone. Proceed with caution.

## Prerequisites

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console has the permission to **update** the target OceanBase cluster.

* The target OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

   Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over the OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../300.manage-a-cluster/400.take-over-a-cluster.md).

* Check whether the zone to be stopped hosts the leader replica of the tenant. If yes, make sure that a full-featured replica of the tenant is available. Otherwise, stopping the zone will cause business interruptions.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the **Zones** list, find the row of the target zone and choose **More > Stop** in the **Actions** column.

5. In the dialog box that appears, specify whether to initiate a minor compaction before stopping the observer process, and click **Stop**. By default, this option is selected.

   A minor compaction prolongs the response time required to stop the observer process, but significantly shortens the time required to restore the OBServer node.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the zone is displayed as **Stopped** in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page, the zone is stopped.

7. (Optional) If you want to use the zone again, find it in the **Zones** list, and click **Start** in the **Actions** column.
