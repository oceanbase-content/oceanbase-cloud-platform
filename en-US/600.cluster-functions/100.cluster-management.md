# Cluster management

An OceanBase Database cluster spans one or more regions. A Region consists of one or more zones, and one or more servers are deployed in each zone. A region refers to a city or a geographic region. If an OceanBase Database cluster spans two or more regions, the data and services of the OceanBase Database cluster have the geo-disaster recovery capability. If a cluster has only one region, the data and services of OceanBase Database will be affected when a city-wide failure occurs. A zone refers to an IDC with an independent network and power supply. The OceanBase Database cluster that spans two or more zones in the same region has the disaster recovery capability when servers in one zone fail. Generally, each zone of an OceanBase Database cluster retains only one data replica. If the cluster has only one zone, this cluster has no disaster recovery capability. If your cluster has several servers deployed in only one IDC, you can create virtual zones and distribute your servers among them to have disaster recovery capability.

OceanBase Database provides innovative disaster recovery capabilities in several deployment modes. For example, you can deploy your cluster in five IDCs across three regions to implement zero-loss disaster recovery for city-wide disasters or in three IDCs of the same city to implement zero-loss disaster recovery for IDC failures. OceanBase Database retains data replicas in multiple regions or zones and uses the Paxos consensus protocol to ensure strong consistency among replicas. When city-wide disasters or IDC failures occur, OceanBase Database ensures and balances the data reliability and the database service availability.

The zero-loss disaster recovery capability of OceanBase Database also facilitates operations on the cluster. When you replace or repair an IDC or server, you can delete the corresponding IDC or server, replace or repair it, and then add a new one. OceanBase Database automatically replicates and balances data to avoid impact on the database service.

OceanBase Database runs the observer process on each server of the cluster. The observer process manages various features of the database service, including resource management, tenant creation, data distribution management, Paxos protocol for data replicas, and standalone or distributed data query and modification. OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) supports automatic startup of the observer process along with the OCP-Agent service upon power-on. When the server is restarted, the observer process is automatically started and restored to the status before the server restart. For more information, see [OCP-Agent processes](../850.host-features/800.ocp-agent-process.md).

## View cluster overview information

Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster Overview** page. To view the cluster overview data, the current logged-on user must have the management permission or read-only permission on clusters.

The **Cluster Overview** page displays the general information about clusters of the logged-on user in the following sections: **Clusters**, **Top 5 Clusters by QPS**, and **Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Compaction**.

You can also [take over a cluster](300.manage-a-cluster/400.take-over-a-cluster.md) or create a cluster. You can **create a standalone centralized database** or **create a distributed cluster**.

* **Create a standalone centralized database**

   OceanBase Database in standalone centralized mode supports only one host, one zone, and one OBServer node, and does not support multi-replica data protection. Compared with a distributed cluster, a standalone centralized database is lightweight and small in size, and is suitable for development and testing and business systems that do not require high data security. You can deploy OceanBase Database in standalone centralized mode for quick experience. For more information, see [Create a standalone centralized database](200.create-a-cluster/200.create-a-standalone-centralized-cluster.md).

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Only OceanBase Database V4.1.0 and later support the standalone centralized mode. </p>
  </main>

* **Create a distributed cluster**

   OceanBase Database in distributed mode supports multiple hosts, multiple zones, and multiple OBServer nodes for multi-replica data protection. Compared with a standalone centralized database, a distributed cluster provides financial-grade high availability and smooth scaling capabilities. It is highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL databases and is suitable for core business systems that demand high data security. For more information, see [Create a distributed cluster](200.create-a-cluster/100.create-a-distributed-cluster.md).

### Clusters

This section displays the name, status, allocated CPU, allocated memory, used disk space, tenants, OceanBase version, deployment mode, CPU architecture, created on and alert information of each cluster. Batch query of cluster names is supported, and spaces are used between each cluster name.

You can click the name of a cluster to go to the cluster details page. For more information, see [Overview of the Cluster Details page](300.manage-a-cluster/300.upgrade-to-distributed-cluster.md).

### Top 5 Clusters by QPS

This section displays top 5 clusters sorted by a specified performance metric in descending order in a specified time range. You can specify the performance metric and the time range as needed. You can click the icon in the upper-right corner to zoom in the chart for a better view.

* The following performance metrics are available: **QPS (time/s), Query response time (us), Number of active sessions**, and **CPU Usage (percent)**.

   | Metric | Description |
   |------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | QPS (time/s) | The queries per second of the cluster. It reflects the SQL statement processing performance of the OceanBase cluster.  |
   | Query response time | The average query response time of the cluster, in Âµs.  |
   | Number of active sessions | The total number of active sessions in the selected time range.  |
   | CPU Usage (percent) | The average CPU utilization of all OBServer nodes in the cluster.  |

* The following time ranges are available: **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, and **Last 7 Days**.

### Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Compaction

This section displays a bar chart of top 5 clusters with the longest major compaction time in the last three days. A major compaction merges all dynamic and static data, which is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated through minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, a major compaction of data is performed to obtain a major version.

This section is empty if no major compaction has been performed in the last three days. You can click the icon in the upper-right corner to zoom in the chart for a better view.
