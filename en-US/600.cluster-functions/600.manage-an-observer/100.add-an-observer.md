# Add an OBServer node

You can add OBServer nodes to a cluster that you manage to scale out the cluster.

## Prerequisites

* You have the permission to update the target cluster.

* The target OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster.

  Otherwise, you need to take over the OceanBase cluster to the current OCP cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../300.manage-a-cluster/400.take-over-a-cluster.md).

* You cannot add an OBServer node to a **standalone centralized** database.
  
## Add OBServer nodes to the cluster

You can perform the following steps to add OBServer nodes to multiple zones at a time.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. Go to the **Overview** page of the cluster and click **Add OBServer** in the upper-right corner.

5. In the dialog box that appears, specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|--------|
   | Software Package Type  | The software installation package type of the OBServer node, which is the same as that of the current OceanBase cluster. If the system cannot identify the software installation package type of the OceanBase cluster, you need to select an appropriate installation package based on the version of your operating system.  |
   | OBServer Information | The model and IP address of the host of one or more OBServer nodes to be added. <br>If you do not need to add an OBServer node to a zone, click the **Delete** icon of the corresponding zone to remove the zone.  |
   | Custom Settings  | The OS user, path, and port number of the OBServer node. For more information, see the section about custom settings in [Create a distributed cluster](../200.create-a-cluster/100.create-a-distributed-cluster.md). |
   | Parameter Settings | The startup parameters of the OBServer node. For more information, see [Overview](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001375595). |

6. Click **OK**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress. You can also view the task progress in **Task Center**.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the OBServer node is displayed as **Running** in the OBServer node list on the **Overview** page of the cluster, the OBServer node is added.

## Add one or more OBServer nodes to a zone

You can perform the following steps to add one or more OBServer nodes to one zone.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. On the **Overview** page, find the row of the target zone in the **Zones** list, and click **Add OBServer** in the **Actions** column.

5. In the dialog box that appears, specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|--------|
   | Software Package Type  | The software installation package type of the OBServer node, which is the same as that of the current OceanBase cluster. If the system cannot identify the software installation package type of the OceanBase cluster, you need to select an appropriate installation package based on the version of your operating system.  |
   | OBServer Information | The model and IP address of the host of one or more OBServer nodes to be added. <br>By default, only one OBServer node will be added. To add more OBServer nodes, click **Add OBServer**.  |
   | Custom Settings  | The OS user, path, and port number of the OBServer node. For more information, see the section about custom settings in [Create a distributed cluster](../200.create-a-cluster/100.create-a-distributed-cluster.md). |
   | Parameter Settings | The startup parameters of the OBServer node. For more information, see [Overview](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001375595). |
