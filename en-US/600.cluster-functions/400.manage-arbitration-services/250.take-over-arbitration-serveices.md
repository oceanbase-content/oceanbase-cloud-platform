## Prerequisites

No OceanBase cluster is deployed on the host where the arbitration service to be migrated is deployed.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster Overview** page.

3. Click **Arbitration Service Management** in the upper-right corner.

4. On the arbitration service list page that appears, click **Take Over Arbitration Service**.

5. In the **Take Over Arbitration Service** panel, specify the basic information about the arbitration service.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |---------|----------|
   | Host | The host for deploying the arbitration service. You can deploy multiple arbitration service processes on the same host. You can search for hosts by IP address or click [Add Host](../../850.host-features/200.add-a-host.md) in the drop-down list to add an available host.  |
   | Service Port | The port of the arbitration service. By default, Port 2882 is used. You can use a custom port based on your business requirements. Make sure that the port is not occupied.  |
   | Note | The supplementary description of the arbitration service. This parameter is optional.  |

6. Click **Check** to verify the specified information.

   * If the verification fails, you can perform troubleshooting or modify the parameters as prompted.

   * If the verification succeeds, you can confirm the arbitration service version, operating system user, software path, and associated OceanBase clusters and tenants.

7. Click **OK**.
