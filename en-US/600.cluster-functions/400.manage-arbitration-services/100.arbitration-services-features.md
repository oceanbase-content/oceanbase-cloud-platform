## What is arbitration service?

The arbitration service is a new feature introduced in OceanBase Database V4.1. The arbitration service not only solves the problem of increased response time that occurs when a replica in the primary region fails in the deployment mode of three IDCs across two regions, but also reduces the cross-region bandwidth overheads and minimizes the costs of the third IDC.

The arbitration service maintains arbitration members corresponding to log streams of a tenant. An arbitration member has the following characteristics:

* An arbitration member votes in leader election, Paxos Prepare, and member group change, but does not participate in Paxos Accept.

* An arbitration member does not store logs and has no MemTables or SSTables. Therefore, it consumes minimal bandwidth, memory, disk, and CPU resources.

* An arbitration member cannot be elected as a leader to provide services.

If half of the full-featured replicas in a cluster fail, which means that the logs on the majority of replicas cannot be synchronized, the arbitration service enables the cluster to automatically downgrade to restore the database services, with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 0. After the failed replicas are recovered, the cluster automatically upgrades and restores the original replica list.

## View the arbitration service list

Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster Overview** page. To view the cluster overview data, the current logged-on user must have the management permission or read-only permission on clusters. On the **Overview** page, click the **...** icon and choose **Arbitration Service Management** to go to the **Arbitration Service List** page.

The **Arbitration Service List** page displays information about each arbitration service in the following columns: **Host**, **Tag**, **Service Port**, **Description**, **Version**, **Associated Cluster**, **Created At**, and **Status**. You can query an arbitration service by host IP address or cluster name.

* You can click the IP address of a host to go to the host monitoring page. For more information, see [View host performance](../../880.manage-performance-monitoring/100.performance-monitoring-overview/300.view-host-performance.md) and [View host resources](../../880.manage-performance-monitoring/100.performance-monitoring-overview/700.view-host-resources.md).

* You can click the name of a cluster associated with an arbitration service to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster. For more information, see [Overview page of a cluster](../300.manage-a-cluster/200.overview-of-the-cluster-details-page.md).

* You can filter arbitration services by **Status**.

## Manage arbitration services

You can also create, stop, start, upgrade, restart, and delete an arbitration service. For more information, see [Create an arbitration service](200.creat-arbitration-services.md), [Stop an arbitration service](300.stop-arbitration-services.md), [Start an arbitration service](400.start-arbitration-services.md), [Upgrade an arbitration service](500.upgrade-arbitration-services.md), [Restart an arbitration service](600.restart-arbitration-services.md), [Delete an arbitration service](700.delete-arbitration-services.md).
