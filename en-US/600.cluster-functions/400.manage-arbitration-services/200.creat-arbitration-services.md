# Create an arbitration service

This topic describes how to create an arbitration service.

## Prerequisites

The host for deploying an arbitration service has not been deployed with any OceanBase Database cluster.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3. In the upper-right corner of the **Cluster Overview** page, click the **More** icon, and choose **Arbitration Service Management**.

4. On the **Arbitration Service List** page, click **Create Arbitration Service**.

5. In the **Create Arbitration Service** panel, configure the basic information of the arbitration service.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |---------|----------|
   | Host | The host for deploying the arbitration service. You can deploy multiple arbitration service processes on the same host. You can search for hosts by IP address or click [Add Host](../../850.host-features/200.add-a-host.md) in the drop-down list to add an available host.  |
   | Service Version | The OceanBase Database version of the cluster. The hardware architecture of the selected version must be the same as that of the host. Only software packages of OceanBase Database V4.1 or later are supported. You can also click **Add Version** at the bottom of the drop-down list to upload a software package of the required version.  |
   | OS User | The OS user that you use to install and run OceanBase Database. You cannot edit this parameter here. To change the user, you can modify the default value of the `ocp.operation.default.os.user` parameter. For more information, see [Modify system parameters](../../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-system-parameter/200.modify-system-parameters.md). <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4>The modification of the <code>ocp.operation.default.os.user</code> parameter affects only the following operations: <a href="../200.create-a-cluster/100.create-a-distributed-cluster.md">create a distributed cluster</a>, <a href="../../800.obproxy-functions/200.create-an-obproxy-cluster.md">create an OBProxy cluster</a>, and create an arbitration service. Other settings of existing clusters are not affected. </li></ul></main> |
   | Software Path | The path where the arbitration service software is installed. You must have the **write** permission on the path on the host. <ul><li> If the value of **OS User** is `admin`, that of **Software Path** is `/home/admin/oceanbase` by default. You can specify a custom path. </li><li>If the value of **OS User** is not `admin`, that of **Software Path** is `/opt/oceanbase/oceanbase` by default. You can specify a custom path. </li></ul> |
   | Service Port | The port of the arbitration service. By default, Port 2882 is used. You can use a custom port based on your business requirements. Make sure that the port is not occupied.  |
   | Description | The supplementary description of the arbitration service. This parameter is optional.  |

6. Click **OK**. In the pop-up window that appears, click the task ID to view the task execution status.

   The system verifies the parameter settings. If the settings fail the verification, you can perform troubleshooting or modify the parameters as prompted.
