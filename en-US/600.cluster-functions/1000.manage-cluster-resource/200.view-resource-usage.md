# View resource usage

This topic describes how to view the resource usage trend of the current cluster.

## View the resource usage trend

You can view trend charts in the following sections of the **Resource Usage Tendency** module: **Allocated CPU**, **Allocated Memory**, **Log Disk in Use**, **Data Disk Used**, and **Replicas**.

The **Allocated CPU** and **Allocated Memory** sections display the resource allocation trend, and the **Log Disk in Use** and **Data Disk Used**sections display the resource usage trend. In the resource usage trend charts in the **Allocated CPU** and **Allocated Memory** sections, move the pointer over a point in time of resource change to view the events that occur between the current resource allocation point in time and the previous resource allocation point in time. The event information is generated based on the differences between the two resource allocation data records. Not all associated events are displayed.

<h4>Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, resource usage trend charts are not displayed in the <strong>Replicas</strong> section. </li>
<li>If the cluster version is earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0, resource usage trend charts are not displayed in the <strong>Log Disk in Use</strong> section. </li>
<li>Resource trend data is collected every hour. The data shows the historical resource allocation and usage tendencies. However, the data is not suitable for observing real-time resource changes. </li>
</ul>
</main>

* Click **All** in the upper-right corner, and choose **All, Zone1, Zone2**, or **Zone3** from the drop-down list to view the resource usage trends in different scopes.

* Click **Last 7 Days** in the upper-right corner, and choose Last 7 Days, Last Month, Last Six Months, or Last Year to view the resource usage trends in different periods.

* Click **Percentage** or **Absolute Value** to switch the mode of the trend charts.

* Click the filter icon in the upper-right corner of each trend chart to view the resource usage of different zones.

## View the resource allocation

You can view the following information in the **Allocated Resources** section: **Tenant Name, Allocated CPU (Core), Allocated Memory (G), Allocated Log Disk, Data Disk Used**, and **Replicas**. You can click the name of a tenant to go to its overview page.

<h4>Note</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, the <strong>Replicas</strong> column is not displayed. </li>
<li>If the cluster version is earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0, the <strong>Allocated Log Disk</strong> column is not displayed. </li>
<li>Due to high query costs, the query results of tenant resource allocation statistics are returned based on cached data. This may result in a 2-minute lag with the real-time condition. In this case, for the allocated resources that do not belong to any tenant, N/A is displayed in the Tenant Name column, indicating that such resources can be released. </li>
</ul>
