# View the unit distribution

You can view the unit distribution to check the physical distribution and resource usage of each tenant in OceanBase clusters.

The **Unit Distribution** page provides the **Unit View** and **Replica View** tabs.

To view the unit distribution, perform the following operations: In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. On the **Clusters** page, click the name of a cluster. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resource Management**. The **Unit Distribution** page automatically appears.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V4.0 or later, the <strong>Replica View</strong> tab is not displayed. </p>
  </main>

## Unit View

The **Unit View** tab automatically appears and shows the distribution of resource units in a view. Each column indicates an OBServer node.

* Click **Tenant** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select a tenant.

* Click **Region** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select the physical region where the current cluster is located.

* Click **Zone** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select Zone1, Zone2, or Zone3.

* Click **Type** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select the host type.

* Enable unit load balancing:

  * If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V4.x, enable **Automatic Migration**. When the system resource usage is unbalanced, resource units are automatically migrated in the background to achieve load balancing. If the server is offline or in the **DELETING** state, automatic migration does not take effect.

  * If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V2.x or V3.x, enable **Enable Migration**. When the system resource usage is unbalanced, resource units can be automatically migrated in the background or manually migrated. If the server is offline or in the **DELETING** state, automatic migration does not take effect.

* Enable **Auto Refresh**. The unit view refreshes every second so that you can view the latest unit distribution.

  * Check load balancing of the cluster:

    You can view the values of **Allocated Memory**, **Allocated CPU**, and **Data Disk Used** of each zone to check whether the usage of the same type of resource is balanced across the servers in the zone. If no, you can modify the load balancing parameters of the OceanBase cluster to implement load balancing.

  * Evaluate whether the cluster needs a scale-out:

    You can determine whether the data disk capacity is sufficient based on the value of **Data Disk Used**. When the data disk usage reaches 80%, you can scale out the cluster by adding a server to ensure normal data disk usage.

  * View the resource distribution of a tenant:

    Click **Tenant** in the upper part of the view and select the name of the target tenant from the drop-down list. Then, click **OK** to view the resource distribution of the tenant.

  * View the details of a tenant:

    * Hover the pointer over the name of a tenant to view its information, including the name, ID, status, zone priorities, locality, and arbitration service status.
    * A unit card next to the tenant displays the resource specifications and replica information of the tenant. Hover the pointer over the unit card to view the OBServer node information, including the unit ID, tenant name, resource pool, number of CPU cores, memory size (GB), and used space of the data disk (GB).

        <main id="notice" type='explain'>
        <h4>Note</h4>
        <p>In OceanBase Database V4.0 and later, the following OBServer node information is added to a unit card:<ul><li>The total size of the log disk (GB), IOPS, and used size of the log disk (GB). </li><li>The <b>Leader</b> label, which indicates that a leader log stream resides on the current OBServer node. </li><li>The label that indicates whether a leader exists and the replica type. Valid values: <b>FULL</b> (full-featured replica) and <b>READONLY</b> (read-only replica). </li></ul></p>
        </main>

    Click the name of the tenant to go to its **Overview** page. On this page, you can view the tenant details, including the replica details, zone priorities, and allowlist information.

  * Manually implement load balancing:

    If the built-in load balancing algorithms of the OceanBase cluster cannot meet your needs, you can click a unit card next to the tenant to manually migrate resources, but only within a single zone.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>We recommend that you disable the automatic load balancing feature of the OceanBase cluster before you manually implement load balancing, because the feature may migrate the unit back to the original locality. </p>
    </main>

  * View the number of units:
  
      View the number of resource units in the **Number of Units** section. When the number of resource units is greater than the number of tenants, it indicates that some resource units are not associated with any tenant. In this case, you can drop or merge resource units that remain in the idle state for more than 1 hour.

## Replica View

Click the **Replica View** tab. This tab shows the distribution of replicas in a view. Each column indicates an OBServer node.

* Click **Tenant** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select a tenant.

* Click **Region** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select the physical region where the current cluster is located.

* Click **Zone** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select Zone1, Zone2, or Zone3.

* Click **Type** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select the host type.

* Enable **Auto Refresh**. The replica view refreshes every 30 seconds so that you can view the latest replica distribution.

  * Check load balancing of the cluster:

    You can view the values of **Allocated Memory**, **Allocated CPU**, and **Data Disk Used** of each zone to check whether the usage of the same type of resource is balanced across the servers in the zone. If no, you can modify the load balancing parameters of the OceanBase cluster to implement load balancing.

    In the following figure, ③ indicates the allocated memory on the current OBServer node, and ④ indicates the total memory on the current OBServer node.

  * Evaluate whether the cluster needs a scale-out:

    You may consider a cluster scale-out when the value of **Data Disk Used** reaches 80%.

  * View the resource distribution of a tenant:

    Select the target tenant from the **Tenant** drop-down list, and then click **OK** to view the resource distribution of the tenant.

    Hover the pointer over the replica card next to the tenant to view the number of leader replicas and the total number of replicas of the tenant.

    In the following figure, ① indicates the number of leader replicas in the OBServer, and ② indicates the total number of replicas in the OBServer.

  * View the details of a tenant:

    Click the name of the tenant to go to its **Overview** page. On this page, you can view the tenant details, including the replica details, zone priorities, and allowlist information.

  * Stop or start an OBServer node:

    Click the host card next to a host address to start or stop the OBServer node.

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Stopping an OBServer node will switch all its traffic and the leaders to another OBServer node. Proceed with caution. </p>
