# Upgrade a standalone centralized database to a distributed cluster

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to upgrade a standalone centralized OceanBase database to a distributed cluster online. This topic describes the procedure.

## Background information

* After you upgrade a cluster to span multiple hosts in a single zone, only the computing capabilities of the cluster are improved. The cluster does not support multi-replica high availability and applies only to a development or test environment.
* If you upgrade a cluster to span an even number of zones, the cluster cannot meet the high availability requirements and has data security risks. We recommend that you adjust the configurations to ensure an odd number of zones or enable the arbitration service for the cluster or tenant.

## Prerequisites

You have deployed a standalone centralized OceanBase database.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. On the **Overview** page of the cluster, click **Scale to a distributed cluster**.

5. In the panel that appears on the right, configure the following information.

   * Specify relevant information.

       By default, the system allows you to upgrade a cluster by adding zones. You can also upgrade a cluster by adding OBServer nodes. To do so, click the **Add OBServer Node** tab and upgrade the cluster to span multiple hosts in a single zone.

       To add more zones, you can click **+NewZone** in the lower part.

       |    **Parameter**     | **Description** |
       |---------|-------|
       | Zone Name | The name of the zone.    |
       | IDC      | The IDC where the zone is located.     |
       | Model     | Optional. If you select a model, the host list is filtered based on the model.   |
       | CPU Architecture  | The CPU architecture of the host in the zone must be the same as that of the cluster. <br>After you select an architecture, the system checks whether an installation package for the CPU architecture of the current cluster exists. If the installation package for the specified architecture does not exist, the zone cannot be added.   |
       | Software Package Type  | The type of the software installation package of the OceanBase cluster. If the system cannot identify the software installation package type of the OceanBase cluster, you need to select an appropriate installation package based on the version of your operating system. |
       | Host      | When you upgrade a cluster by adding zones, you can select only one host as the OBServer node and RootServer. When you upgrade a cluster by adding OBServer nodes, you can select multiple hosts. <ul><li>If no host is available in the drop-down list, you can click **Add Host** in the drop-down list to add one. For more information, see [Add a host](../../850.host-features/200.add-a-host.md). </li><li>In a production environment, we recommend that the size of the log disk be at least three times the memory size of the host. To avoid performance issues, we recommend that you do not create the data directory and the log directory on the same disk. </li></ul> |

       <main id="notice" type='explain'>
       <h4>Note</h4>
       <p><ul><li>In addition to adding zones, you can also delete zones other than Zone1. You must retain at least one zone. Otherwise, you cannot upgrade the database to a distributed cluster. </li><li>The name, IDC, model, CPU architecture, and host information of Zone1 cannot be modified. </li></ul></p>
       </main>

   * Complete the custom settings. Specifically, configure the OS user, path, and port number of the OBServer node. For more information, see the section about custom settings in [Create a distributed cluster](../200.create-a-cluster/100.create-a-distributed-cluster.md).

   * Configure the startup parameters of the OBServer node. For more information, see [Overview](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001103709).

   * Choose whether to select **Add Replicas for All Tenants** in the **Tenant Configuration** section.

       If you select this option, replicas are added for all tenants in the cluster. The replica type, unit config, and unit quantity of each tenant are the same as those in the original zone.

6. Click **OK**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the task progress.

   You can also view the task progress in **Task Center**.
