# Restart a cluster

You can restart the observer processes of all nodes in the cluster or specific zones based on your business requirements.

## Prerequisites

* The logged-on user has the permission to manage the cluster.

* If a multi-replica OceanBase cluster is to be restarted, the cluster must have three or more replicas. In this case, the OceanBase cluster is restarted in rolling mode, without affecting the business.

   If the OceanBase cluster has less than three replicas, the business will be interrupted during the restart.

* A **standalone centralized** database supports only the **Force Restart** mode.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. Click the More icon in the upper-right corner on the **Overview** page of the cluster and select **Restart Cluster**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, set the following parameters and click **Restart**.

   * Set **Restart Scope** to **All**, or specify one or more zones.

      * If you set **Restart Scope** to **All**, the system will restart the observer processes of all nodes in the cluster.

      * If you set **Restart Scope** to specific zones, the system will restart the observer processes of these zones.

   * Set **Restart Method** to **Restart**or **Force Restart**.

      * **Restart** (recommended): Business access to the database is not interrupted.

      * **Force Restart**: Business access to the database is interrupted and the business will become unavailable.

   * Specify whether to initiate a minor compaction before stopping the observer process. By default, this option is selected. A minor compaction prolongs the response time required to stop the observer process, but significantly shortens the time required to restore the OBServer node.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress.

   If the task status is **Completed**, and the specific zones in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page are in the **Running** state, the cluster is successfully restarted.
