# Take over a cluster

You can perform this operation to take over an OceanBase cluster created in a command-line tool or another OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster and maintain and manage the OceanBase cluster in the current OCP cluster.

## Prerequisites

* The logon user who takes over the OceanBase cluster has the Cluster Manager role, or the permission to create a cluster.

* All OBServer nodes in the OceanBase cluster to be taken over are running normally.

* Always take over the primary OceanBase cluster first:

  * In a single-OCP scenario, the primary OceanBase cluster is taken over before the standby OceanBase cluster.

  * In a multi-OCP scenario, the primary OceanBase cluster is taken over in any OCP before the standby OceanBase cluster is taken over in any OCP.

    <p>After an OceanBase cluster is taken over, it cannot be maintained and monitored in the original OCP cluster. We recommend that you evaluate the risk before taking any action. </p>
   </main>

## Procedure

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

2. On the page that appears, click **Take over Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

3. Connect to the cluster.

   The following two connection modes are supported:

   1. **Direct Connect**: Specify **Access URL**, **Port**, and **root@sys Password** of the cluster, and enter the password of the proxyro user as needed. Then, click **Next**.

      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>The password of the proxyro account is used by OBProxy to access an OceanBase cluster. You can enter the password here to ensure consistency. For more information about the proxyro account, see <a href="../../800.obproxy-functions/300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/900.proxyro-user-management.md">Manage the proxyro account</a>. </p>
      </main>

   2. **OBProxy**: Specify **Access URL**, **Port**, **Cluster Name**, **Cluster ID (Optional)**, and **root@sys Password** of the cluster, and enter the password of the proxyro user as needed, which is used by OBProxy to access the OceanBase cluster. Then, click **Next**.

      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p><ul><li>When you are taking over a standby cluster, you must specify the cluster ID. If you need to take over both the primary and standby clusters, take over the primary cluster first. </li><li>The password of the proxyro account is used by OBProxy to access an OceanBase cluster. You can enter the password here to ensure consistency.

4. After the cluster is connected, perform pre-takeover check.

   * If the check succeeds and the hosts corresponding to some OBServer nodes are not managed by the OCP cluster and need to be taken over, you must select the credentials of these hosts for unified management in the OCP cluster.

   * If the check fails, hover the pointer over the icon next to **Failed**, modify the OBServer configuration as prompted, and then click **Recheck**.

5. Click **Submit**.

   After the task is submitted, you can view the task execution progress on the current page or return to the overview page of the cluster.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>When OCP connects to a database, the credential string of the database must exist in credential management. After you take over a cluster to an OCP cluster, you can import the file of cluster credentials exported in the <a href="650.migrate-a-cluster.md">migrate a cluster</a> step to the OCP cluster. This way, you can upload cluster credentials in batches. For more information, see <a href="../../1600.system-management-features/700.manage-password-box/300.import-a-credential.md">Import a credential</a>. </p>
