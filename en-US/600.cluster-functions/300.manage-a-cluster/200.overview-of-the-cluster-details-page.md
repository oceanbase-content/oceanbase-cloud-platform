## Protection modes

* Maximum performance: It protects user data and maximizes the performance of the primary cluster. In this mode, the log transfer between the primary cluster and all standby clusters is asynchronous.

* Maximum availability: Normally, the primary cluster keeps synchronous log transfer with only one standby cluster.

* Maximum protection: The primary cluster keeps synchronous log transfer with only one standby cluster, and asynchronous log transfer with other standby clusters.

## Switch between clusters

To view the information about another cluster, click the cluster name in the upper-left corner of the **Overview** page and select the target cluster to switch to its overview page.
