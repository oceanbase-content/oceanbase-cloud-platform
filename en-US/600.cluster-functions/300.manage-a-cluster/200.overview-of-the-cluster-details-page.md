# View the details of a cluster

On the Overview page of a cluster, you can view its basic information, resource usage, alerts, system events of the last seven days, zones, and OBServer nodes, and can perform routine cluster maintenance.

## View the basic information

You can view the parameters of a cluster on its overview page: **Cluster Type, OceanBase Database Version, Regions, Deployment Mode, CPU Architecture, Servers, Partitions, Tenants, Created By, OBProxy Cluster, Software Installation Path, Data Disk Path, Log Disk Path**, and **ConfigUrl**.

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|---|
| Cluster Type | The type of the cluster. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, the cluster type is no longer displayed. </blockquote> |
| OceanBase Database Version | The OceanBase Database version of the cluster.  |
| Regions | The number of regions in the cluster.  |
| Deployment Mode | The deployment mode of the cluster.  <li>The value 1 indicates that the cluster has one zone and the zone has one host.    </li><li> The value 1-1 indicates that the cluster has two zones, and each zone has one host.    </li><li> The value N-N-...N (M Ns) indicates that the cluster has M zones and each zone has N hosts.  </li> |
| CPU Architecture | OCP automatically identifies the hardware architecture of the host when it is added. If multiple different hardware architectures exist in the cluster, the information about all hardware architectures is displayed.  |
| Servers | The number of hosts in the cluster.  |
| Partitions | The number of partitions for the tables in the cluster.  |
| Tenants | The number of tenants in the cluster.  |
| Created By | The username of the user that created the cluster.  |
| OBProxy Cluster | The OBProxy cluster that is associated with the current OceanBase cluster.  </br><li> If the cluster is not associated with an OBProxy cluster, click **Associate OBProxy Cluster** to associate it with one or more OBProxy clusters.    </li><li>If the cluster is associated with OBProxy clusters, you can click the edit icon to add or delete OBProxy clusters.  </li> |
| Software Installation Path | The software installation path specified when the cluster was created.  |
| Data Disk Path | The data disk path specified when the cluster was created.  |
| Log Disk Path | The log disk path specified when the cluster was created.  |
| ConfigUrl | The cluster URL. You can click the copy icon to copy it.  |

## View resource usage

In the Resource Usage section, you can view the following information about the current cluster: **Allocated CPU**, **Allocated Memory**, **Allocated Log Disk**, and **Data Disk Used**. You can manage the cluster based on the resource usage.

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>If the cluster version is earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0, the <b>Allocated Log Disk</b> information is not displayed in the <b>Resource Usage</b> section. </p>
</main>

## View system events in the last seven days

You can set query conditions in **System Events in Last 7 Days** to query the system events in the last seven days.

* You can specify a time range in the time selection field.

* You can filter events in the Event Name column.

* You can filter events by module.

* You can sort events in ascending or descending order by start time.

The system lists the system events that meet the foregoing conditions you specified.

## View zones

In the Zones section, you can view the following zone parameters and search for zones by these parameters: **Zone Name, Region, IDC, Servers, RootService, CPU Architecture**, and **Status**. The Actions column provides the following options: **Add OBServer, Restart, Stop**, and **Delete**. For more information, see [Add an OBServer](../600.manage-an-observer/100.add-an-observer.md), [Restart a zone](../500.manage-a-zone/200.restart-a-zone.md), [Stop a zone](../500.manage-a-zone/300.stop-a-zone.md), and [Delete a zone](../500.manage-a-zone/400.delete-a-zone.md).
