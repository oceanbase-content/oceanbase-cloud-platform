# Create a standby cluster

If you already have a primary cluster, you can create a standby cluster for it.

## Prerequisites

* You are logged on with an account that has the permission to manage the cluster.
* The version of the primary cluster is earlier than V4.0.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. You can go to the Create Standby Cluster page in one of the following ways:

   * Click **Create Cluster** in the upper-right corner of the **Clusters** page. On the **Create Cluster** page, choose **Standby Cluster** for **Cluster Type**, and select the corresponding primary cluster from the **Primary Cluster** drop-down list.

   * In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target primary cluster and click its name. In the upper-right corner on the **Overview** page, click the **More** icon and choose **Create Standby Cluster**.

3. On the **Create Cluster** page, configure the basic information of the standby cluster.

   The following table describes the fields in the Basic Settings section.

   | Field | Description |
   |----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Cluster Type** | Select **Standby**. Make sure that the primary cluster is created.  |
   | **Primary Cluster** | Select the primary cluster and the system will create a standby cluster of the selected primary cluster.  |
   | **Standby Cluster OceanBase Version** | Select an OceanBase Database version the same as that of the primary cluster.  <ul><li> If the version exists in the drop-down list, select it.    </li><li> Otherwise, click **Add Version** at the bottom of the list to upload the version. </li> </ul> |

4. Set the deployment mode of the cluster.

   By default, three zones are added for a cluster. To deploy more than three zones for the cluster, click **Add**.

   To deploy less than three zones for the cluster, click the Delete icon after the zone to be deleted.

   The following table describes the settings for each zone.

   | Field | Description |
   |-----|-------|
   | **Zone Name** | You can retain the default name or define a custom name.  A zone name must consist of 2 to 48 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_), and start with a letter.  In an OceanBase cluster that consists of multiple zones, you must have a zone that shares the same region as that of the Primary Zone.  |
   | **IDC** | The IDC of the zone. Each zone can be deployed in only one IDC.  |
   | **Host Type** | Optional.  If you select a host type, the host list is filtered based on the host type.  |
   | **CPU Architecture** | If multiple installation packages with different architectures are available for the selected OceanBase Database version, the selected hardware architecture of the host must match the software package. <blockquote>**Notice**</br><ul><li>By default, the architecture of the first installation package is used. You can change the architecture. After you change the architecture, you can select a host of the selected architecture from the drop-down list of the **Host** column. </li><li>You can set different architectures for the zones. However, the deployment mode with a hybrid architecture may have stability and performance issues. Proceed with caution. </li></blockquote> |
   | **Host** | You can select or add hosts.  |
   | **Root Server** | You can select an IP address as the host for the Root Service. If you want to create a multi-replica OceanBase cluster, you must specify this parameter for each zone.  |

5. Turn on **Parameter Configurations** and configure the cluster parameters.

   * You can add startup parameters one by one and set values as shown in section ① of the following figure.

   * You can also click **Select Parameter Template** as shown in section ② of the following figure and select a parameter template. The system will automatically populate parameters in this section by using the template.

    <ul>
    <li>If you use OceanBase Database V2.2.77, we recommend that you use the built-in <strong>2.2.77 Version Parameter Template</strong>. This template contains general parameters of OceanBase Database V2.2.77. You can configure a cluster based on this template.</li>
    <li>If no cluster parameter template is available, you can click <strong>Create Cluster Template</strong> to create one. For more information, see <a href="../1200.cluster-parameters-template-management.md">Manage cluster parameter templates</a>.</li>

6. Turn on **Custom Settings** to configure paths and ports.

   * Configure the paths:
      1. In the **Path Settings** section, specify the **Software Installation Path, Data Disk Path**, and **Log Disk Path** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the paths can be used. If a path cannot be used, you can perform troubleshooting based on the test results, or use another path.

   * Configure the ports:
      1. In the **Port Settings** section, specify **SQL Port** and **RPC Port** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the ports are occupied. If a port is occupied, you must use another port.
