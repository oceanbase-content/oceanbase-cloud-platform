# Migrate a cluster

This topic describes how to migrate an OceanBase cluster from one OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster to another.

<p>After a cluster is migrated from an OCP cluster, it is no longer managed by the OCP cluster. Proceed with caution. </p>
</main>

## Prerequisites

* You have the permission to manage clusters.

* The OceanBase cluster to be migrated is in the **STOPPED**, **RUNNING**, or **UNAVAILABLE** state.

* Migrate the cluster in off-peak hours.

* When you migrate an OceanBase cluster, you must first migrate the standby cluster.

  * When you migrate an OceanBase cluster from an OCP cluster, you must first migrate the standby OceanBase cluster and then the primary OceanBase cluster.

  * When you migrate OceanBase clusters deployed in primary/standby mode that are managed by different OCP clusters, you must first migrate the standby OceanBase cluster and then migrate the primary OceanBase cluster.

* If other services are deployed on the host where the OceanBase cluster is deployed, you cannot delete this host from the OCP cluster when you migrate the OceanBase cluster.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. On the **Overview** page of the target cluster, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and choose **Migrate Cluster**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, perform the following operations:

   1. Select the host where the cluster is deployed and delete it from the OCP cluster.

      Before you take over the OceanBase cluster to the new OCP cluster, you must first delete the host where the OceanBase cluster is deployed from the original OCP cluster. You can also delete the host on the **Hosts** page. For more information, see [Delete a host](../../850.host-features/550.delete-a-host.md).

        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>If no other services are deployed on the host, we recommend that you delete the host. If you choose to retain the host and deploy other clusters on this host, adverse effects can be caused on the original cluster. Exercise caution when you choose to retain the host, and understand the risks in advance. </p>
        </main>

   2. Configure an encryption key for the credential file and export the credentials.

      After you click **Export Credential**, the system will export the credentials of the cluster to be migrated. After the cluster is taken over to the new OCP cluster, you can import cluster credentials in batches for future use. For more information, see [Import a credential](../../1600.system-management-features/700.manage-password-box/300.import-connection.md).

   3. Enter **move out** in the textbox and click **Move Out** to submit a task to migrate the OceanBase cluster.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress of the task.

   After the task status changes to **Completed** and the OceanBase cluster disappears from the cluster list on the **Clusters** page, the cluster is migrated.
