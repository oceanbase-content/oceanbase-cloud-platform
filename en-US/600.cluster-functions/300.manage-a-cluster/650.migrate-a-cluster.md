# Move out a cluster

This topic describes how to move out an OceanBase cluster from one OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster to another.

<p>After an OceanBase cluster is moved out, it is no longer managed by the original OCP cluster. Proceed with caution. </p>
</main>

## Prerequisites

* You have the permission to manage clusters.

* The OceanBase cluster to be moved out is in the **STOPPED**, **RUNNING**, or **UNAVAILABLE** state.

* Move out the OceanBase cluster in off-peak hours.

* When you move out an OceanBase cluster, you must first move out the standby cluster.

  * In a single-OCP scenario, you must move out the standby OceanBase cluster before the primary OceanBase cluster.

  * In a multi-OCP scenario, you must first move out the standby OceanBase cluster from its OCP cluster and then move out the primary OceanBase cluster from its OCP cluster.

* If other services are deployed on the host where the OceanBase cluster is deployed, you cannot delete this host from OCP when you move out the OceanBase cluster.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Clusters** page, find the target OceanBase cluster and click its name.

4. On the **Overview** page of the cluster, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and select **Migrate Cluster**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, perform the following operations:

   1. **Export credentials**: Enter the credential file encryption key and click **Export Credential**. Then, click **Next**.

      We recommend that you export the credentials so that you can directly import them after taking over the OceanBase cluster. After you click **Export Credential**, the system will export the credentials of the cluster to be migrated. After the OceanBase cluster is taken over to the new OCP cluster, you can import its credentials in batches for future use. For more information, see [Import a credential](../../1600.system-management-features/100.manage-password-box/300.import-a-credential.md).

   2. **Move out the OceanBase cluster**:

      1. Select the host where the OceanBase cluster is deployed, and delete it from the original OCP cluster before you take over the OceanBase cluster to the new OCP cluster. You can also delete the host on the **Hosts** page. For more information, see [Delete a host](../../850.host-features/550.delete-a-host.md).

         <h4>Notice</h4>
         <p>If no other services are deployed on the host, we recommend that you delete the host. If you choose to retain the host and deploy other clusters on this host, adverse effects can be caused on the original cluster. Exercise caution when you choose to retain the host, and understand the risks in advance. </p>
         </main>

      2. Specify whether to retain information about the OceanBase cluster to be moved out. If you enable **Retain Cluster Information**, information about the OceanBase cluster is retained in the original OCP cluster for the config server. This way, business applications can still connect to the OceanBase cluster by using OBProxy.

      3. Enter **move out** in the textbox and click **Move Out** to submit a task to move out the OceanBase cluster.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   If the task status is **Completed**, and the status of this OceanBase cluster on the **Clusters** page is **Moved Out**, the cluster is successfully moved out.

7. On the **Clusters** page, delete the cluster.
