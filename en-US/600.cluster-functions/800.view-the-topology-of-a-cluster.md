# View the topology of a cluster

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides a topology diagram that allows you to view the logical relationships between zones and OBServer nodes in a cluster or tenant.

1. Log in to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Overview** page.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Topology** to view the cluster topology.

   * If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is earlier than V4.0, you can see the protection mode information in the upper-left corner of the page. For more information, see [View the details of a cluster](300.manage-a-cluster/200.overview-of-the-cluster-details-page.md).

   * For a standby cluster, you can also see its synchronization status.

   You can use the functional buttons in the upper-right corner of the page to resize or refresh the topology.

   The topology consists of four layers from top to bottom: cluster, cluster arbitration service, zones, and OBServer nodes. You can click **+** beneath a zone to show all OBServer nodes in the zone.

   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The <b>Cluster quorum service</b> layer is displayed only after you add an arbitration service to the cluster. </p>
   </main>

## Cluster

The ID, type (primary or standby), and current status of the OceanBase cluster are displayed next to the cluster icon. In the case of a standby cluster, you can also see its latency next to the cluster icon. The topology also provides some cluster management options.

For a primary cluster, you can create a backup cluster, add a zone, edit a zone, add an OBServer node, upgrade the version, change the password, and restart, stop or delete the cluster. For a standby cluster, you can perform operations such as viewing the cluster and switching to the primary cluster.

## Cluster arbitration service

The endpoint and status of the arbitration service are displayed next to the cluster arbitration service icon.

Hover the pointer over the cluster arbitration service icon to view the complete information about the service and whether the service is enabled for the tenants in the cluster.

## Zone

The name and current status of a zone are displayed next to the zone icon.

You can hover the pointer over a zone icon to view information about the zone, such as the QPS, number of connections, and the number of units.

The topology also provides some zone management options that allow you to add an OBServer node to a zone and restart, stop, or delete a zone.

## OBServer node

The IP address and current status of an OBServer node are displayed next to the node icon.

You can hover the pointer over a node icon to view the information about the OBServer node, such as the QPS, number of connections, and SQL ports.

The topology also provides some OBServer node management options that allow you to restart, start, stop, replace, and delete an OBServer node and stop the observer process.
