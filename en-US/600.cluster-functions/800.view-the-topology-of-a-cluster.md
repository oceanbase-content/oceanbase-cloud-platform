# View the topology of a cluster

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides a topology diagram that allows you to view the logical relationships between zones and OBServer nodes in a cluster or tenant.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster Overview** page.

3. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Topology** to view the cluster topology.

   You can use the functional buttons in the upper-right corner of the page to resize or refresh the topology.

   The topology consists of three layers from top to bottom: cluster, zones, and OBServer nodes. You can click **+** beneath a zone to show all OBServer nodes in the zone.

## Cluster

The ID and current status of the OceanBase cluster is displayed next to the cluster icon.

The topology also provides some cluster management options. You can add a zone, add an OBServer node, upgrade the version, change the password, and restart, stop, or delete the cluster.

## Zone

The name and current status of a zone are displayed next to the zone icon.

You can hover the pointer over a zone icon to view information about the zone, such as the QPS, number of connections, and the number of units.

The topology also provides some zone management options that allow you to add an OBServer node to a zone and restart, stop, or delete a zone.

## OBServer node

The IP address and current status of an OBServer node are displayed next to the node icon.

You can hover the pointer over a node icon to view the information about the OBServer node, such as the QPS, number of connections, and SQL ports.

The topology also provides some OBServer node management options that allow you to restart, start, stop, replace, and delete an OBServer node and stop the observer process.
