Processes 
==============================

This topic describes the processes of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). 

Process description 
----------------------------------------

### OBServer 

This section describes business-related processes that run on an OBServer. 
**Note**



ocp_agent and ocp_monitor are not actual processes. They are two collections of processes. You can start or stop them by using the ocp_agent_ctl.py script. 

* After a host is added in OCP, the ocp_agent processes automatically start. Exceptions of ocp_agent processes may cause the host to become offline.

  

* After an OBServer is deployed through OCP, the ocp_monitor processes automatically start. Exceptions of an ocp_monitor process may cause TopSQL monitoring,plan cache monitoring, or OceanBase log alerts to become unavailable.

| ocp_agentd    | -              | The process automatically starts when an ocp-agent process starts and automatically stops when it has no process to guard. | It guards all the ocp_agent processes.

### OCP Server 

This section describes business-related processes that run on an OCP server. 


|  Process   | Listening port |                                                                                                Description                                                                                                 |
