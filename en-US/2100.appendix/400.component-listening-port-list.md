## Deployment units

| Deployment unit | Description |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| OCP-Server | Docker containing the OCP management service program |
| OCP-Console | OCP web management console |
| OCP-Agent | Agents deployed on the hosts that are managed by the OCP, including OCP-Agent and OB-Agent |
| OBServer | OceanBase program deployed in OCP |
| OBProxy | OBProxy program deployed in OCP |
| Backup-Agent | Backup and restore agent deployed in OCP |
| Application | Application that accesses the database |

## Listening port list

| Deployment unit | Listening port | Protocol | Listening port modification | Accessible deployment units | Remarks |
|--------------|------------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OCP-Server | 8080 | HTTP | Modify the system parameter `server.port` of OCP. The parameter takes effect upon a restart.  | OBServer, OBProxy, OCP-Console, and Backup-Agent | The web service of the OCP-Server listens to the port. In most cases, other components access OCP-Server by using an SLB address or a DNS address.  |
| OBServer | 2881 | TCP | Modification not supported | OBProxy, OCP-Server, and Applications | 1. This is the SQL listening port of OBServer nodes. 2. We recommend that you do not connect applications to OBServer nodes in direct connection mode.  |
| OBServer | 2882 | TCP | Modification not supported | OBServer | The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication port between two OBServer nodes. |
| OBProxy | 2883 | TCP | Modification not supported | Applications, OCP-Server, and Backup-Agent | 1. This is the listening port of OBProxies. 2. In general, applications access OBServer nodes by using OBProxies. |
| OBProxy | 2884 | HTTP | Modification not supported | OCP-Server | The API listening port of OBProxy monitoring metrics. |
| OCP-Agent | 62888 | HTTP | You can change the port on the parameters page of the OCP console. The change takes effect globally.  | OCP-Server | The API listening port of OCP-Agent. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In OCP V4.0.1 and later, you can change the port. </p></main> |
| OCP-Agent | 62889 | HTTP | You can change the port on the parameters page of the OCP console. The change takes effect globally.  | OCP-Server | The listening port of OCP-Agent monitoring data. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In OCP V4.0.1 and later, you can change the port. </p></main> |
| Backup-Agent | 2911 | TCP | You can change the port on the backup and restore management page of the OCP console. | None | The local listening port of Backup-Agent for performing backup. The port is not open to external access. If the port is used by another program, the Backup-Agent program will fail to start.  |
| Backup-Agent | 2912 | TCP | You can change the port on the backup and restore management page of the OCP console. | None | The local listening port of Backup-Agent for performing recovery. The port is not open to external access. If the port is used by another program, the Backup-Agent program will fail to start.  |
