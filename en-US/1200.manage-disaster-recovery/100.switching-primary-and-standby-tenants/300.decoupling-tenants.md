# Decouple a standby tenant from its primary tenant

This topic describes how to decouple a standby tenant from its primary tenant. After the decoupling, the standby tenant becomes an independent tenant that supports read and write services.

## Prerequisites

The current tenant is a standby tenant.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**. In the tenant list, find the target standby tenant and click its name to go to its basic information page.

2. On the page that appears, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and select **Decouple Primary and Standby Clusters**.

3. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to initiate a decoupling task.

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>By default, the service names of the decoupled tenant and its downstream tenants are set to empty to avoid exceptions. After the standby tenant is decoupled, it becomes an independent tenant and no longer synchronizes data from the original primary tenant. Proceed with caution. </p>
    </ul>
    </main>

4. After the decoupling operation, the decoupled tenant becomes a new indepedent tenant. You can view details about this decoupling event in operation audit records. For more information, see [View operation audit records](../../1600.system-management-features/400.view-operation-audit.md).
