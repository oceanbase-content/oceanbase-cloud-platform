# Decouple a standby tenant from its primary tenant

This topic describes how to decouple a standby tenant from its primary tenant. After the decoupling, the standby tenant becomes an independent tenant that supports read and write services.

## Prerequisites

The current tenant is a standby tenant.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**. On the **Tenants** page, select the target standby tenant.

2. On the page that appears, click the More icon in the upper-right corner and select **Decouple Primary and Standby Clusters** from the menu.

3. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to initiate a decoupling task.
