Register an OCP cluster
============================================

This topic describes how to bind a follower OCP cluster to the leader OCP cluster when you log on to the follower OCP cluster for the first time.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* You have created leader and follower OCP clusters in the multi-cluster mode.

  * You have deployed leader and follower OCP clusters. For more information, see [Deploy OCP clusters in the multi-cluster mode](../../300.deployment-guide/100.deployment-overview/200.multi-node-deplpyment-overview.md).

  * To enable the multi-cluster mode for multiple common OCP clusters, configure one of them as the leader and the others as followers. For more information, see [Enable or disable the multi-cluster mode](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/900.multi-cluster-mode-switch.md).

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>In this scenario, the primary OceanBase clusters of the leader and follower OCP clusters must have different names.</p>
   </main>

* You have obtained the JDBC information for accessing the MetaDB of the leader OCP cluster.

Procedure
------------------------------

1. Go to the logon page of a follower OCP cluster, enter **Username** and **Password** , and click **Log On** .

   The **Welcome to Multi-cluster mode** page appears.

   ![11021633](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5527567361/p346873.png)

2. Specify the fields of **Connection Information of Leader OCP Metadatabase**.

   | Parameter |                                               Description                                                |
   |-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Host URL  | The IP address of the node where the MetaDB of the leader OCP cluster resides, for example, xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. |
   | Port      | The number of the port for accessing the MetaDB of the leader OCP cluster, for example, 2881.            |
   | Username  | The username for accessing the MetaDB of the leader OCP cluster, for example, ocp@ocp_meta#ocp321.       |
   | Password  | The password for accessing the MetaDB of the leader OCP cluster, for example, aA\*\*\*\*\*\*1j.          |
   | Database  | The database name of the MetaDB of the leader OCP cluster, for example, meta_01.                         |

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The preceding parameters are required for accessing the MetaDB through JDBC. They can also be used to access the MetaDB in the background. If a follower OCP cluster fails to be bound to the leader OCP cluster, you can run the following command in the background to access the MetaDB for troubleshooting.</p>
   </main>

   ```sql
   ### Run the following command in OBClient to connect to the database server.
   obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -uocp@ocp_meta#ocp321 -paA******1j -Dmeta_01
   ```

3. Click **Bind to Leader** **OCP** .

   If the system switches to the business mode, the follower OCP cluster is bound to the leader OCP cluster.

   If the leader OCP cluster is also bound to other follower OCP clusters, the other follower OCP clusters may not be synchronously displayed in the **OCPs** list of the newly bound follower OCP cluster due to the setting of the `ocp.multi-cluster.replication.interval.seconds` parameter. For more information, see the descriptions about **OCPs** in [Leader \& Follower Details](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/300.overview-of-multiple-clusters.md).
