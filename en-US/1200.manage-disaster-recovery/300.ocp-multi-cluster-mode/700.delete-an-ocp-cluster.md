Delete a faulty follower OCP cluster
=========================================================

This topic describes how to delete a follower OCP cluster that has a heartbeat timeout exception.

Background
-------------------------------

Scenario:

After a failover occurs, OCP clusters in the OCPs list no longer report heartbeat information to the original leader OCP cluster. Therefore, the **OCPs** list of the original leader OCP cluster may contain an OCP cluster whose heartbeat detection timed out. In this case, information of other OCP clusters is still stored in the original leader OCP cluster.

You need to delete information of the OCP clusters and the OceanBase clusters managed by the original leader OCP cluster from the original leader.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* You have registered OCP clusters. For more information, see [Register an OCP cluster](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/200.register-an-ocp-cluster.md).

* The **OCPs** list of the current OCP cluster contains an OCP cluster that has a heartbeat timeout exception. One of the following conditions is met:

  * The current OCP cluster cannot access the MetaDB of the OCP cluster that has a heartbeat timeout exception.

  * The current OCP cluster can access the MetaDB of the OCP cluster that has a heartbeat timeout exception, but its leader is no longer the current OCP cluster.
