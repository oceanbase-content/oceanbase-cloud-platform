Unbind a leader and a follower OCP cluster
===============================================================

This topic describes how to unbind a follower and a leader OCP cluster. If the follower OCP cluster is required for other business purposes, you must unbind it from its leader first.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* You have [Registered the follower OCP cluster](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/200.register-an-ocp-cluster.md).

* The follower OCP cluster communicates with its leader properly. Otherwise, [Delete the faulty follower OCP cluster](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/700.delete-an-ocp-cluster.md).

Unbind a follower OCP cluster
--------------------------------------------------

1. Log on to the follower OCP cluster.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management \> OCP Multi-cluster Mode** .

3. Click the **Leader \& Follower Details** tab.

4. In the **Current OCP Basic Information** section, click **Unbind from Leader Cluster** .

   The system displays a confirmation dialog box.

     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>  After the follower OCP cluster is unbound from its leader, you can bind it with another leader OCP cluster or leave it as a common OCP cluster. Proceed with caution.</p>
     </main>

5. In the confirmation dialog box, click **Unbind from Leader Cluster** .

Unbind a leader OCP cluster
------------------------------------------------

1. Log on to a follower OCP cluster that runs properly.

2. Switch the follower OCP cluster to a leader. For more information, see [Switch an OCP cluster in daily maintenance](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/500.switch-an-ocp-cluster-in-daily-maintenance.md).

   Wait for the follower OCP cluster to take a leader role.

3. Log on to the original leader OCP cluster.

   The OCP cluster becomes a follower.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** \> **OCP Multi-cluster Mode** .

5. In the **Current OCP Basic Information** section of the **Leader \& Follower Details** tab, click **Unbind from Leader Cluster** .

   The following message appears: **The follower OCP is unbound from the leader OCP.** The system returns to the **Welcome to Multi-cluster mode** page.

   In this case, the original leader OCP cluster is deleted from the OCPs list. You can rebind the follower OCP cluster to the original or a new leader OCP cluster, or use it as a common OCP cluster to provide services to external applications.
