Switch an OCP cluster in a failover
========================================================

This topic describes how to switch a follower OCP cluster to a leader in a failover. When the leader OCP cluster is unavailable, you can switch a follower to a leader in a failover.

Background
-------------------------------

When the leader OCP is unavailable, you can select a follower based on your business requirements and switch it to a leader in a failover. After the failover is completed, the follower OCP cluster becomes a leader of all OCP clusters connected to it. For more information about the failover, see [OCP multi-cluster mode](../../300.deployment-guide/100.deploying-enterprise-ocp/100.deployment-overview/200.multi-node-deplpyment-overview.md).

Prerequisite
---------------------------------

All follower OCP clusters are operating properly.

Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management \> OCP Multi-cluster Mode** .

3. In the **Current OCP Basic Information** section of the **Leader \& Follower Details** tab, click **Switch to Leader OCP** .

4. Click **Switch Disaster Recovery** .

5. After the failover is completed, choose **System Management \> Tasks** in the left-side navigation pane and view the task progress. For more information, see [Manage tasks](../../1600.system-management-features/100.manage-tasks.md).

What to do next
------------------------------------

After the failover is completed, perform one of the following steps based on the status of the OCPs list of the leader OCP cluster:

1. The original leader OCP becomes a follower that has a heartbeat timeout exception. Therefore, you must manually delete information of the original leader OCP. For more information, see [Delete a faulty follower OCP cluster](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/700.delete-an-ocp-cluster.md).

2. The original leader OCP cluster recovers. Therefore, you must delete information of other OCP clusters from the original leader OCP cluster, change the role of the original leader to a follower, and then bind it to the new leader. For more information, see [Delete a faulty follower OCP cluster](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/700.delete-an-ocp-cluster.md) and [Register an OCP cluster](../300.ocp-multi-cluster-mode/200.register-an-ocp-cluster.md).
