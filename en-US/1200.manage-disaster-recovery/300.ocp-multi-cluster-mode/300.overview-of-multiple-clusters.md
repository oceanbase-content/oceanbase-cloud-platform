View Leader \& Follower Details
===============================================

This topic describes how to view the information of OCP clusters and their relationships in the multi-cluster mode.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Applicability</h4>
<p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Cloud Platform Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Cloud Platform Community Edition does not support the multi-cluster mode. </p>
</main>

Prerequisite
---------------------------------

You have enabled the multi-cluster mode for the current OCP cluster.

Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** \> **OCP Multi-cluster Mode** .

3. Click the **Leader \& Follower Details** tab.

   The tab consists of two sections: **Current OCP Basic Information** and **OCPs** .
   * **Current OCP Basic Information**

     This section displays the basic information of the current OCP cluster, including its status, role, version, heartbeat, synchronization, and access URL. It also provides actions for the current OCP cluster.
     * **Version** : If the version of the current OCP cluster is different from that of its leader, an exclamation point ( **!** ) appears.

     * **Switch to Leader OCP** : This option appears only when the current OCP cluster is a follower.

     * **Unbind from Leader Cluster** : This option appears only when the current OCP cluster is a follower.

   * **OCPs**

     This section displays the basic information of all leader and follower OCP clusters, including their roles, versions, statuses, and access URLs. It also provides actions for these OCP clusters.
     * **Version** : If the version of the current OCP cluster is different from that of its leader, an exclamation point ( **!** ) appears.

     * **Delete** : This option is displayed for the leader OCP cluster only when a follower OCP cluster has a heartbeat timeout exception.

     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p><li>The OCPs list is not displayed: Data in the OCPs list comes from the MetaDB of the leader OCP cluster. When no leader OCP cluster is available, the OCPs list is not displayed due to the absence of a data source. This issue may occur when you <a href="500.switch-an-ocp-cluster-in-daily-maintenance.md">Switch an OCP cluster in daily maintenance</a> or <a href="600.switch-an-ocp-cluster-in-a-failover.md">Switch an OCP cluster in a failover</a>.</li><li>The OCPs list is not fully displayed: The ocp.multi-cluster.replication.interval.seconds parameter specifies the data synchronization interval between a follower OCP cluster and its leader. When a new follower OCP cluster is bound to the leader cluster, it is not displayed in the OCPs list before data of the leader is synchronized to other follower OCP clusters.</li></p>
