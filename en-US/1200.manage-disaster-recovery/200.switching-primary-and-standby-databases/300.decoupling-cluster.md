# Decouple a standby cluster from the primary cluster

This topic describes how to decouple a standby cluster from the primary cluster so that the standby cluster becomes a new cluster irrelevant to the original primary cluster.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to a standby cluster.

* The primary cluster, standby cluster, and all zones are running.

* The logged-on user has the permission to manage the cluster.

* The OceanBase Database version is V2.2.77 BP9 or later.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** . In the **Clusters** list, click the name of the target cluster.

2. Click the more icon (...) in the upper-right corner and select **Decouple to Become Primary Cluster** . Alternatively, click **Topology** in the left-side navigation pane to go to the cluster topology page, click the more icon (...) of the cluster, and select **Decouple to Become Primary Cluster** .

3. (Optional) To ensure data consistency between the standby cluster and the original primary cluster after the standby cluster is decoupled, disable the connection and input of the original primary cluster.

   1. Disable the OBProxy cluster and business traffic input.

   2. Manually configure the firewall to isolate the decoupled standby cluster and the original primary cluster.

4. In the **Decouple to Become Primary Cluster** dialog box, enter a new name for the decoupled standby cluster and then enter the word "confirm", and click **Decouple** to initiate a decouple task.

   After the decouple task is submitted, the states of the primary cluster and the standby cluster to be decoupled change to **Decoupling** .

    <ul>
    <li>The name of the decoupled cluster must be unique and cannot be set to the Hash value of any other cluster.</li>
    <li>The monitoring history of the standby cluster will be cleared after it is decoupled. Proceed with caution.</li>
    </ul>

5. The standby cluster becomes a new primary cluster after it is decoupled. You can view the details of the decouple event on the Previous Events page. For more information, see [View Operation Audit](../../1600.system-management-features/200.view-operation-audit.md).
