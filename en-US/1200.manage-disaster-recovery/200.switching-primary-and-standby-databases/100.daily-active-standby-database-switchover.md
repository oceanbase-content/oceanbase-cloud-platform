# Routine primary/standby cluster switchover

This topic describes the steps of routine switchover between the primary cluster and a standby cluster.

## Background

When you have logged on to a standby cluster, you can switch it to the primary role through the routine switchover feature as needed.

The routine primary/standby switchover feature is supported in OceanBase Database V2.2.50 and later versions. You can start the switchover when no backup task is in progress.
**Note**

Carry out the routine primary/standby switchover after the backup and restoration operations in the current cluster are completed.

## Procedure

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click Clusters. In the Clusters list, click the name of the target cluster.

3. On the page that appears, click the More icon in the upper-right corner to expand the hidden menu and select **Switch to Primary Cluster: Daily Switch** .
