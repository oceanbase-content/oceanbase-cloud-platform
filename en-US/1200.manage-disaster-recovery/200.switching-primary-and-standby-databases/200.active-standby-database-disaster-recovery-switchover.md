    <ul>
    <li>After the switchover succeeds, the original primary cluster does not switch to be a standby cluster. Instead, it becomes a separate unusable cluster. We recommend that you delete it from OCP. For more information, see <a href="../../600.cluster-functions/300.manage-a-cluster/700.delete-a-cluster.md">Delete a cluster</a>.</li>
    <li>After the switchover succeeds, other standby clusters of the original primary cluster cannot synchronize data with the new primary cluster. We recommend that you delete the standby clusters from the OCP. See <a href="../../600.cluster-functions/300.manage-a-cluster/700.delete-a-cluster.md">Delete a cluster</a>.</li>
