View details of multiple zones
===================================================

This topic describes the information provided on the multi-zone details page.

Prerequisite
---------------------------------

The OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster has been deployed in multi-zone mode. For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Enterprise Edition](../../300.deployment-guide/100.deploying-enterprise-ocp/100.deployment-overview/200.multi-node-deplpyment-overview.md).

Procedure
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management \> OCP Multi-zone Mode** .

3. Click the **Zone Details** tab.

   This tab displays the information of **All Zones** and **IDCs Not Associated with Zones** .
   * All Zones

     This list displays all the current zones, OCP instances in each zone, and IDCs in each zone. The zone of the current OCP cluster is identified.

     Item â‘  indicates that the current OCP cluster belongs to the az0 zone, which contains two IDCs: bj1 and bj2. Two OCP instances are created in this zone to manage the services involved in these two IDCs.

     * Address: the address used for accessing the OCP cluster in this zone through a browser.

     * ConfigUrl: the ConfigUrl that is preferentially used by the OBProxy for the OCP or OceanBase cluster in the zone.

     * monitordb: the address of the MonitorDB used by the OCP cluster of the zone. This address can be shared by multiple zones.

   * IDCs Not Associated with Zones

     The list shows all IDCs that are not associated with any zones.

     In multi-zone mode, OCP preferentially manages services in the zone where it is deployed. If an IDC that is not associated with any zones is involved in OCP O\&M, the OCP O\&M is not affected, but the IDC and the OCP cluster may be located in different regions.

     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>When you create an IDC in the OCP cluster of a zone, this IDC is automatically associated with the current zone.</p>
