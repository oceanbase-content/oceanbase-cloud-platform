Create a blocking condition 
================================================

This topic describes how to block an alert. 

Background information 
-------------------------------------------

Topics [View alert events](../900.alert-management/1200.view-alert-events-1.md) and [View alert notification history](../900.alert-management/1300.view-alert-notification-records-1.md) describe how to block alerts on the **Alert Events** and **Notification History** tabs. However, these methods allow you to block only reported alerts for a specified period. This topic describes how to create a blocking condition. It is a more flexible method that allows you to block unwanted alerts in advance. 

After a blocking condition is created, the system starts to block alerts based on the condition. The blocking condition takes effect in 30s.

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** **\>** **Alerts** .

   

3. On the Alert Blocking tab, click **Create Blocking Condition** .

   

4. Configure the blocking condition in the **Create Blocking Condition** dialog box.
