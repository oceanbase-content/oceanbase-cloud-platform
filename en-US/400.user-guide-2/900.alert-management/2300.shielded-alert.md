# Create a blocking condition

This topic describes how to block an alert.

## Background information

On the **Alert Events** tab, you can quickly block an alert item with an alert event. For more information, see [View an alert event](22.view-alert-events.md). This topic describes how to create a blocking condition. It is a more flexible method that allows you to block unwanted alerts in advance.

After a blocking condition is created, the system starts to block alerts based on the condition. The blocking condition takes effect in 30s.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Alerts**.

3. On the **Alert Masking** tab, click **Create Blocking Condition**.

4. Configure the blocking condition in the **Create Blocking Condition** dialog box.

   | Field | Description |
   |--------|--------|
   | Application | The alert source. Options include **OceanBase**, **OBProxy**, **OCP**, **OMS**, and **Logs**. |
   | Masked Object Types | The blocking scope. Valid values: **All**, **Tenant**, and **Server**. The options vary with the setting of **Application**. |
   | Blocking Object | The alert objects to be blocked. You can select specific alert objects as needed. </br>If you select **All**, you can select **Excluded Objects** on the right to exclude objects that do not need to be blocked. |
   | Mask Alert Rules | Select one or more alert rules to be blocked.  |
   | Tags | Specify one or more tags to block alerts for specific metrics, for example, slow SQL alerts. You can filter SQL statements by their IDs. You can add up to eight tags.  |
   | Blocking End Time | Specify the end time for the blocking condition. The blocked alerts will not be reported before the end time expires. This field is required.  <ul><li>Click the **End Time** field to select the end time. </li><li> You can also click a time next to the **End Time** field. For example, if you click **6 Hours**, the system enters the time six hours later from the current time in the **End Time** field. </li> |
   | Daily Block Period | You can toggle on the **Daily Block Period** switch, and specify the start time and end time. The system blocks alerts during the specified period every day. |

   If you want to block a specific alert, you can add a tag to exactly match the alert. The following example shows how to block a slow SQL alert for the **sys** tenant in the **obcee** cluster.

   * (Optional) Add a tag named **ob_cluster** and set the tag value to the cluster name **obcee**.
   * (Optional) Add a tag named **ob_cluster_id** and set the tag value to the cluster ID **1**. The cluster ID is used to distinguish between primary and standby clusters.
   * (Optional) Add a tag named **tenant_name** and set the tag value to the tenant name **sys**.
   * Add a tag named **sql_id** and set the tag value to the ID of the slow SQL statement.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The system blocks an alert only when the alert matches all the tags. The <strong>optional</strong> configurations are intended to help you better understand and use tags. You can ignore these configurations in practice.</p>

5. Click **OK**.

   The system returns to the **Blocking Conditions** list, which contains the newly created condition.

   By default, all alert blocking conditions are displayed in the **Blocking Conditions** list.
