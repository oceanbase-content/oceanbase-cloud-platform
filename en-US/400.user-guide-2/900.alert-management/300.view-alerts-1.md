View alert items 
=====================================

This topic describes how to view alert items. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console is granted the ADMIN or ALARM_VIEWER role.

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** **\>** **Alerts** .

   

3. On the **Alert Item Configuration** tab, view the alert items. 

   In the search bar in the upper part of the tab, specify the search criteria and click Search. The alert items that match the search criteria are displayed in the alert item list. 

   The **Actions** column of an alert item provides options for you to edit, copy, or delete the alert item. For more information, see [Edit an alert item](5.edit-an-alarm-item-1.md), [Copy an alert item](4.copy-alerts.md), or [Delete an alert item](6.delete-an-alarm-item-1.md). 
   **Note**

   

   System built-in alert items cannot be deleted. You can only edit some of their parameters, such as the operation rule, duration, and alert enabling status.
