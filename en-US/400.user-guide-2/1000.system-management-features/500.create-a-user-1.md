Create a user
==================================

This topic describes how to create a user.

Background
-------------------------------

We recommend that you use users with different permissions to manage OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) and assign each user the minimum necessary permissions. In this way, each user can only operate in their authorized scope. This prevents misoperations by non-professionals and information leakage, and therefore ensures information security.

The minimum permission in OCP is the PROFILE role. A user with this role can visit the user center and modify their personal information and password box.

**Prerequisites**
--------------------------------------

The logged-on user has the ADMIN or USER_MANAGER role.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** **\>** **Security** .

3. Click **Create User** in the upper-right corner of the **User Management** tab.

4. Specify the following basic information of the user.
