# Launch an OBProxy

This topic describes how to launch an OBProxy. After you launch an OBProxy, the load balancing weight of the node is resumed. The node is used as a traffic entry for new connections based on the load balancing rules. Business requests are sent to this OBProxy, and the business pressure on the system is reduced.

## Prerequisites

* You are logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.
* The target OBProxy is in the pending takeover or deletion state.
* The target OBProxy is removed.
* The OBProxy cluster contains at least one load balancer instance.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster. Then, the **Overview** page of the OBProxy cluster appears.

4. In the OBProxy list, select the target OBProxy, move the pointer over the **More** icon, and then click **Launch** in the drop-down list.

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Launch**.
