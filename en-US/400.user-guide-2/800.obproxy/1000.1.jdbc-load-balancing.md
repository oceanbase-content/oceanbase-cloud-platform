# Client configuration

To implement load balancing of business traffic, the client driver such as the JDBC driver needs the corresponding traffic entry nodes and traffic allocation strategy. Through client configuration, you can synchronize the node information and load balancing strategy of an OBProxy cluster as an application to the client program. The client obtains the application configuration information for load balancing.

## Add an application

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster. Then, the **Overview** page of the OBProxy cluster appears.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Client Configuration**. Then, the **Client Configuration** overview page appears.
5. Click **Add Application** in the upper-right corner and then enter application information in the right-side pane.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----------|----------|
   | Application Name | The name of the application. It must begin with a letter and can contain 4 to 32 letters, digits, and underscores (_).  <blockquote>**Notice**</br>The application name is globally unique in OCP. </blockquote> |
   | Description | Optional. The description of the application, which must be 0 to 256 characters in length.  |
   | Load Balancer | If multiple load balancing strategies are configured, the client program applies the load balancing configuration in polling mode based on the sequence of configured load balancing strategies.**** You must configure at least one load balancing strategy for the application.  |
   | Strategy | The load balancing strategy. Valid values: **RANDOM**, **SERVERAFFINITY**, and **ROTATION**. You cannot select a strategy repeatedly.  <ul><li>RANDOM: random</li> <li>SERVERAFFINITY: weighting</li><li>ROTATION: polling</li>  </ul> |
   | OBProxy | The OBProxy list for the load balancing strategy in the `IP address:Port number (weight)` format. You can select multiple OBProxies. The weight is used only when the load balancing strategy is set to **SERVERAFFINITY**. The value range for weight is 1 to 10. A greater number indicates a higher weight.  |
   | Global Configuration | The global configuration information about the application.  |
   | OBLB_RETRY_ALL_DOWNS | Optional. The number of connection attempts to all nodes. When this threshold is exceeded, a connection exception is thrown.  |
   | Node Blacklist Strategy | The strategy for blacklisting a node, which is disabled by default. Valid values: NORMAL and RETRYTIMES. <ul><li>NORMAL: the normal strategy. This is the default strategy. If a network exception is thrown for a connection attempt to a node, this node will be blacklisted and no other parameters are needed for judgment. </li> <li>RETRYTIMES: specifies to retry within the specified period. After the specified number of retry attempts to a node is exceeded, the node is blacklisted. The blacklisting judgment is made based on the **RETRYTIMES** and **DURATION** parameters. </li> </ul> |
   | DURATION | The period for retry attempts. This parameter is displayed when **Node Blacklist Strategy** is set to **RETRYTIMES**.  |
   | RETRYTIMES | The period for retry attempts. This parameter is displayed when **Node Blacklist Strategy** is set to **RETRYTIMES**.  |
   | Node Unblacklist Strategy | If this strategy is enabled, a node will be removed from the blacklist when the specified timeout period expires.  |
   | TIMEOUT | The timeout period for blacklisting a node. A node will be removed from the blacklist when the timeout period expires. This parameter is displayed when **Node Unblacklist Strategy** is enabled.  |

6. Click **OK**.

## Modify an application

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster. Then, the **Overview** page of the OBProxy cluster appears.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Client Configuration**. Then, the **Client Configuration** overview page appears.

5. Select the application to edit and then click **Edit** in the upper-right corner.

6. In the dialog box that appears, modify related information and then click **OK** to save the modifications.

## Delete an application

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster. Then, the **Overview** page of the OBProxy cluster appears.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Client Configuration**. Then, the **Client Configuration** overview page appears.

5. Select the application to delete and then click **Delete** in the upper-right corner.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **Yes**.
