Refresh OBProxy configurations 
===================================================

This topic describes how to refresh OBProxy configurations. You can refresh the OBProxy configurations to synchronize the parameter settings of an OBProxy with those of the OBProxy cluster. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console uses the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

  

* In the OBProxies list on the Overview page of the OBProxy cluster, if the **Status** of an OBProxy is **Running** , and an exclamation point ( **!** ) is displayed in its **Parameter Version** column, it means that the parameter version of this OBProxy is different from that of the OBProxy cluster. In this case, you need to refresh the configurations of this OBProxy.

  




Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** .

   

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster to go to the **Overview** page of that OBProxy cluster.

   

4. Find the target OBProxy in the OBProxies list. Click **Refresh Configurations** in the **Actions** column. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/0804306461/p399684.png)

   If you want to refresh the configurations of multiple OBProxies, select target OBProxies and click **Batch Refresh** . ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/0804306461/p399685.png)
   

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** . 

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress. 

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the **Parameter Version** column of the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page does not contain an exclamation point ( **!** ), the OBProxy configurations are refreshed.
