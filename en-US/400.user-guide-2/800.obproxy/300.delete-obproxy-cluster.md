Delete an OBProxy 
======================================

This topic describes how to delete an OBProxy. 

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console uses the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

  

* Make sure that deleting the target OBProxy does not impact your businesses. 

  * No connectable OceanBase clusters are configured for the cluster where the target OBProxy is located, or the configured connectable OceanBase clusters are deprecated.

    
  
  * The cluster where the target OBProxy is located has other functional OBProxies. You have forwarded requests from the target OBProxy to the functional OBProxies through Server Load Balancer (SLB) instances.

    
  

  




Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** .

   

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster to go to the Overview page of that OBProxy cluster.

   

4. Find the OBProxy to delete in the OBProxies list, and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column. ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7704306461/p399665.png)

   To delete all OBProxies in the OBProxy cluster, you can directly delete the cluster. For more information, see [Delete an OBProxy cluster](11.delete-obproxy-cluster-1.md).
   

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete** . 

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of the deletion task. 

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page does not contain the OBProxy, the OBProxy is deleted.
