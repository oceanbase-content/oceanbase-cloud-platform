# View resource usage

This topic describes how to view the resource usage tendency of the current cluster.

In the Resource Usage Tendency section, you can view the **Disk, Replicas, CPU** , and **Memory** trend charts. The CPU and Memory trend charts display the trend of resource allocation, and the Disk and Partitions trend charts display the trend of resource usage. You can move the pointer over a resource change point in time on the CPU utilization or memory usage curve, to view the resource change event of resource allocation at the current point in time relative to the previous point in time. The event information is generated based on the value differences between the two resource allocations and may not include all associated events.

    <ul>
    <li>If the version of the OceanBase Database is V4.0 and later, will be not support viewing <strong>Replicas</strong> column data.</li>
    <li>Due to high query costs, the query results of tenant resource allocation statistics are returned based on cached data. This may result in a 2-minute lag with the real-time condition. In this case, for the allocated resources that do not belong to any tenant, N/A is displayed in the Tenant Name column, indicating that such resources can be released.</li>
