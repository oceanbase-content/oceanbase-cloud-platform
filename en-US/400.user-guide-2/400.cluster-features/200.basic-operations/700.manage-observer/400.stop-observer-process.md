# Stop an OBServer process

This topic describes how to stop an OBServer process.

## Prerequisites

* You have the permission to **Update** a cluster with the current account.

* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OCP cluster.

   Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.take-over-a-cluster.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The cluster overview page appears.

3. On the Clusters page, find the target cluster that includes the OBServer you want to stop in the **Clusters** list and click its name. The **Overview** page of the cluster appears.

4. In the **OBServers** list, click the More icon. In the drop-down list that appears, choose **Stop Process**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Stop** to stop the OBServer process.

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed** and the status of the OBServer is **Stopped** in the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page, the OBServer is stopped.
