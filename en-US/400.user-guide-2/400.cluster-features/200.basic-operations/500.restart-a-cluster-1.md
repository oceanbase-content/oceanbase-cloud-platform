# Restart a cluster

You can restart the observer processes of all nodes in a cluster. You can also restart the observer processes of specific zones as needed.

## Prerequisites

* The logged-on user has the permission to manage the cluster.

* If a multi-replica OceanBase cluster is to be restarted, the cluster must have three or more replicas. In this case, the OceanBase cluster is restarted in rolling mode, without affecting the business.

  If the OceanBase cluster has less than three replicas, the business will be interrupted during the restart.
  
## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. Click the More icon in the upper-right corner on the **Overview** page and select **Restart Cluster** .

4. Specify **Restart Scope** and **Restart Method** .

   * Set the Restart Scope parameter to **All** , a zone, or several zones.

     * If you set the Restart Scope parameter to **All** , the system will restart the observer processes of all nodes in the cluster.

     * If you set the Restart Scope parameter to specific zones, the system will restart the observer processes of these zones.

   * By default, the Restart Method parameter is set to **Restart (recommended)** .

     * **Restart (recommended)** : This method is used to restart the OceanBase cluster in rolling mode. Your business is not interrupted during the restart. If the OceanBase cluster has less than three zones, it cannot be restarted in rolling mode. In this case, you can only forcibly restart the cluster.

     * **Force Restart** : This method is used to synchronously restart all specific zones. In this case, your business may be interrupted. Proceed with caution.

5. Click **Restart** .

   In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** . You can view the progress of the restart task.

   You can also view the progress of the restart task on the **System Management \> Tasks** page.

   If the task status is **Completed** , and the specific zones in the **Zones** list on the **Overview** page are in **Running** state, the cluster is successfully restarted.
