# View the topology of a cluster

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides a topology diagram that allows you to view the logical relationships between zones and OBServer nodes in a cluster or tenant.

In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, select the target cluster and click its name. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Topology** to go to the cluster topology page.

You can use the functional buttons in the upper-right corner of the page to resize or refresh the topology.

The topology consists of three layers from top to bottom: cluster, zone, and server. You can click **+** beneath the zone to show all servers in the zone.
