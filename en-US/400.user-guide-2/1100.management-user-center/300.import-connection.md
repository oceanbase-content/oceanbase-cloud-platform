# Import connection credentials

This topic describes how to import the connection credentials of an OceanBase cluster. When you take over a cluster, such as an OceanBase cluster, you can import the password box from the original OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster.

## Procedure

1. In the upper-right corner of the OCP console, click the username and choose **Password Box**.
   The **Password Box** page appears.
   For security reasons, passwords are displayed as *******.

2. Click **Import Connection** in the upper-right corner.

3. In the **Import Connection** dialog box, click **Upload** to upload the connection file that was exported. For more information, see [Export connection credentials](2.export-connection.md).

4. Enter the encryption password that you set when you export the connection credential. For more information, see [Export connection credentials](2.export-connection.md).

5. Click **Next**.

6. Precheck the connection credential.
   The precheck verifies whether the credential exists and whether the connection succeeds.

7. Select the connection credentials and click **Import**.
