   | Parameter | Description |
   |---------|------|
   | Target Zone | The zone where the new replica exists. You can select a zone of the current cluster.  |
   | Replica Type | Valid values: **Full-featured Replica**, **Read-only Replica**, and **Log Replica**. <ul><li> **Full-featured Replica**: A standard replica that provides complete data and features, including transaction logs, a MemTable, and an SSTable. A full-featured replica can switch to the leader role in an efficient manner to provide services.    </li><li>**Read-only Replica**: A replica that contains full logs, MemTables, and SSTables. It does not participate in log voting as a member of the Paxos group. Instead, it works as an observer that synchronizes logs from the Paxos group members and then locally replays the logs.    </li><li> **Log Replica**: A replica that contains only logs. It does not have a MemTable or an SSTable. It provides log services for external applications and participates in log voting. It can facilitate the recovery of other replicas, but it cannot become the leader to provide database services.  </li></ul> |
   | Unit Specification | The unit specification for the new replica.  |
   | Units | The number of units for the new replica. <blockquote>**Note**</br>If the version of the OceaBase Database is V4.0 and later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones. <ul><li>When you create the first replica of a tenant, the number of units that you specify in this dialog box applies to all zones under this tenant. </li><li>If the tenant already has a replica, you can no longer set the number of units for the new replica. By default, the number of units for the new replica is the same as that for the first created replica. </blockquote> |

6. Click **OK**.
