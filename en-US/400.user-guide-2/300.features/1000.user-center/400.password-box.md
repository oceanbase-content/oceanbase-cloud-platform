# Password box

You can create and manage connection credentials in the password box of your User Center.

## Create a connection

Before you migrate the password box, you must create a connection between the original and the new OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) clusters. For more information, see [Create a connection](../../1100.management-user-center/100.create-connection.md).

## Import a connection

When you take over a cluster, you can export connection credentials from the old OCP cluster and import them to the new OCP cluster. This way, the whole password box is migrated. For more information, see [Import connection credentials](../../1100.management-user-center/300.import-connection.md).

## Accept a connection

Other OCP users can share connection credentials with you. However, you can accept or ignore these connections. For more information, see [Accept a connection](../../1100.management-user-center/800.accept-connection.md) and [Ignore a connection](../../1100.management-user-center/900.ignore-connection.md).

## OceanBase cluster

On the **OceanBase Cluster** tab, you can view the connection information of the OceanBase cluster in the following columns: **Connected Object**, **Destination Type**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Description**. You can also manage the connection credentials of an OceanBase cluster, including Test connection credentials, [Share connection credentials](../../1100.management-user-center/400.share-connection.md), [Edit connection credentials](../../1100.management-user-center/500.edit-connection.md), [Export connection credentials](../../1100.management-user-center/200.export-connection.md), [Delete connection credentials](../../1100.management-user-center/600.del-connection.md), and [Batch operations on connection credentials](../../1100.management-user-center/700.operation-connection.md).

You can filter the destination type by **OceanBase Cluster** and **OceanBase Tenant**.
