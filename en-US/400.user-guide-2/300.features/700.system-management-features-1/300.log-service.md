# Log service

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides log query features.

You can check the project error logs and the component monitoring information to identify the abnormal component, and perform analysis based on the logs.

The log query feature allows you to view the logs of OBServers, OBProxies, hosts, and OCP Agent by time range, object scope, and log type.
In addition, OCP allows you to filter logs by return code, TraceId, host, and time. You can also specify keywords to perform general matching or regular expression matching of logs.

You can view error logs of selected objects and components with status exceptions, and perform log analysis.

For more information, see [Log Query](../../10.system-management-features/14.log-query.md).
