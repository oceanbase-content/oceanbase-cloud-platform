# Alert subscription configuration

By default, alerts can be viewed only on the Alerts page. Users can subscribe to alerts only after the administrator has configured an alert channel.

You can receive alert notifications only when the following two conditions are met:

1. An administrator has configured an alert channel.

2. You have subscribed to alerts.

To configure alert notification settings, perform the following steps:

1. Configure an alert channel. An administrator can configure alert channels.

2. Subscribe to alerts. You can subscribe to alerts based on your actual requirements.

3. Configure the settings for receiving alert notifications. You can specify whether to receive notifications and the reception limits.

## View alert subscriptions

In the upper-right corner of the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, click the username and choose **Alert Subscription**. On the Subscriptions tab, you can filter the alerts by **Application**.

By default, the Subscriptions tab displays **Application**, **Cluster**, **Alert Item Group**, **Subscriber**, and **Subscription Time**.

You can also [create an alert subscription](../../900.alert-management/2000.new-alarm-notification.md) and manage existing alerts. For more information, see [Manage alert subscriptions](../../900.alert-management/2100.manage-alert-subscriptions.md).

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You can only select a cluster on which you have the read permission when you create an alert subscription. If your read permission on the cluster is revoked after you configure an alert subscription, you cannot receive alert messages from this cluster even though the alert subscription configuration still exists.</p>

## View the settings for receiving alert notifications

In the upper-right corner of the OCP console, click the username and choose **Alert Subscription**. On the **Settings for Receiving Notifications** tab, you can configure the settings for receiving alert notifications.

You will also receive fault recovery notifications for alerts that you have subscribed to. Fault recovery notifications cannot be aggregated. To avoid receiving too many such notifications, we recommend that you disable fault recovery notifications. The following table lists the setting items for receiving notifications. You can customize the settings as needed.
