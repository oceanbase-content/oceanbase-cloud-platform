# OBProxy cluster overview

On the OBProxy Cluster Overview page, you can view the basic information of clusters, list of OBProxies, and connectable OceanBase clusters, and can takeover OBProxies, add OBProxies, add accessible OceanBase clusters, upgrade all OBServers, download logs, restart all OBServers, modify proxyro password and delete clusters.

## View the basic information

On the OBProxy Cluster Overview page, you can view the startup method, deployment mode, created by, access URL, parameter version, number of unrefreshed OBProxies, configUrl, add load balancing, modify load balancing, and copy the value of ConfigUrl. For more information, see [Add an OBProxy](../../800.obproxy/600.add-obproxy.md), [Add Connectable OceanBase clusters](../../800.obproxy/1000.add-a-connectable-ob-cluster.md), [Upgrade all OBProxies](../../800.obproxy/500.upgrade-obproxy.md), [Restart all OBProxies](../../800.obproxy/400.restart-obproxy-cluster.md), [Change Password of proxyro User](../../800.obproxy/1500.modify-proxyro-password.md), [Download logs](../../400.cluster-features/200.basic-operations/1600.download-log.md), and [Delete a cluster](../../400.cluster-features/200.basic-operations/300.delete-a-cluster-1.md).

## View OBProxies

The OBProxies list provides information such as the IP address, SQL port number, version, hardware architecture, parameter version, earliest available time, and status of each OBProxy. You can click the **+** icon to view more information, such as the Exporter port number and IDC name. For more information about OBProxy O\&M operations, see [Upgrade an OBProxy](../../800.obproxy/500.upgrade-obproxy.md), [Restart an OBProxy](../../800.obproxy/400.restart-obproxy-cluster.md), [Refresh OBProxy configurations](../../800.obproxy/700.refresh-obproxy-configuration.md), [Download logs](../../400.cluster-features/200.basic-operations/1600.download-log.md), and [Delete an OBProxy](../../800.obproxy/300.delete-obproxy-cluster.md).

## View accessible OceanBase clusters

You can view the cluster name, connected user, number of connections, and status of each accessible OceanBase cluster, and can delete the cluster. For more information, see [Delete a connected OceanBase cluster](../../800.obproxy/1400.delete-a-connected-ob-cluster.md).
