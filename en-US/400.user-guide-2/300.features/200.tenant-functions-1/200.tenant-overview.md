# Tenant overview

A tenant is a logical concept that represents a resource allocation unit in OceanBase Database. It is the basis for the management of database objects and resources. It is critical for system O\&M, especially for the O\&M of cloud databases. After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, click Tenants in the left-side navigation pane. The Tenant Overview page appears. By default, the page displays a list of tenants that you have the permission to view, and displays performance monitoring charts of top 5 tenants.

On the **Tenants** page, you can see a **Tenants** list and charts of **Top 5 Tenants** . You can also perform tenant management operations on this page. For more information, see [Unit specification management](../../500.tenant-functions/200.manage-basic-tenant-operations/200.unit-specification-management.md), [Create a tenant](../../500.tenant-functions/200.manage-basic-tenant-operations/100.create-a-tenant-3.md), [Lock a tenant](../../500.tenant-functions/200.manage-basic-tenant-operations/400.locked-tenants.md), [Copy a tenant](../../500.tenant-functions/200.manage-basic-tenant-operations/500.replication-tenant.md), and [Manage tenant parameter templates](../../500.tenant-functions/1500.tenant-parameter-template-management.md).

## Tenants

The **Tenants** list contains the following columns: **Name, Tenant ID, Cluster, OceanBase Version, Mode, Primary Zone, Read-only, Locked, Status, Created On** , and **Actions** . Batch query of cluster names is supported, and spaces are used between each cluster name.

* You can click the name of a tenant to go to the tenant details page. For more information, see [Tenant overview](../200.tenant-functions-1/300.overview-of-the-Tenant-Details-page.md).

* Click the cluster that the tenant belongs to. The Overview page of the cluster appears. For more information, see [Overview of the cluster details page](../100.cluster-features-1/300.overview-of-the-cluster-details-page.md).

|        Field    | Description      |
|----------------------|--------|
| Primary Zone    | The priority of the partition leader in the tenant.      |
| Status               | The status of the cluster, which can be **Running, Creating, Maintaining** , or **Deleting** .    |
| Created On   | You can sort the tenants by creation time.       |
| Actions    | This column provides the **Lock** and **Copy** options.  <li>If you lock a tenant, the tenant cannot be accessed. </li><li>If you copy a tenant, a new tenant with the same settings will be created in the same cluster. </li><li>For tenants in the **Creating** or **Create Failed** state, the view task details operation is supported. </li><li> For **Create Failed** tenants, delete operations are supported.</li><blockquote>**Notice** <br> **Viewing tasks** and **deleting** only support operations on the tenant overview page.</blockquote>|
