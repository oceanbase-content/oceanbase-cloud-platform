# Tenant overview

A tenant is a logical concept that represents a resource allocation unit in OceanBase Database. It is the basis for the management of database objects and resources. It is critical for system O\&M, especially for the O\&M of cloud databases. After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, click Tenants in the left-side navigation pane. The Tenant Overview page appears. By default, the page displays a list of tenants that you have the permission to view, and displays performance monitoring charts of top 5 tenants.

On the **Tenants** page, you can see a **Tenants** list and charts of **Top 5 Tenants** . You can also perform tenant management operations on this page. For more information, see [Unit specification management](../../5.tenant-functions/2.manage-basic-tenant-operations/2.unit-specification-management.md), [Create a tenant](../../5.tenant-functions/2.manage-basic-tenant-operations/1.create-a-tenant-3.md), [Lock a tenant](../../5.tenant-functions/2.manage-basic-tenant-operations/3.locked-tenants.md), and [Copy a tenant](../../5.tenant-functions/2.manage-basic-tenant-operations/4.replication-tenant.md).

## Tenants

The **Tenants** list contains the following columns: **Tenant Name, Cluster, Replica Distribution, Zone Priority, Tenant Mode, Read-only, Locked, Status, Created At** , and **Actions** .

* You can click the name of a tenant to go to the tenant details page. For more information, see [Tenant overview](3.overview-of-the-Tenant-Details-page.md).

* Click the cluster that the tenant belongs to. The Overview page of the cluster appears. For more information, see [Overview of the cluster details page](../1.cluster-features-1/3.overview-of-the-cluster-details-page.md).
