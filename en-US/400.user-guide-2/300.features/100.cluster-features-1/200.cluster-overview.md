# Cluster overview

Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. The **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears. To view the cluster overview data, the current logon user must have the management permission or read-only permission on clusters.

The **Cluster Overview** page displays the general information about clusters of the user, including the following sections: **Top 5 Clusters by QPS**,**Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Compaction** , **Server Resources** ,**Resource Usage** , and **Clusters**.

You can also take over or create a cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../../400.cluster-features/200.basic-operations/100.take-over-a-cluster.md) and [Create a cluster](../../400.cluster-features/200.basic-operations/200.create-a-cluster-1.md).

## Top 5 Clusters by QPS

This section displays top 5 clusters sorted by a specified performance metric in descending order in a specified time range. You can specify the performance metric and the time range as needed. You can click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner to zoom in the chart for a better view.

  |---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | QPS                 | The number of SQL statements processed per second in an OceanBase cluster managed by the current OCP cluster. It reflects the SQL statement processing performance of the OceanBase cluster. |
  | Query response time | The average query response time of the cluster, in Âµs.                                                                                                                                       |
  | Active sessions     | The total number of active sessions in the selected time range.                                                                                                                              |
  | CPU Usage (percent) | The average CPU utilization of all OBServers in the cluster.                                                                                                                                 |

* The following time ranges are available: **Last 1 Hour** , **Last 24 Hours** , and **Last 7 Days** .

## Top 5 Clusters by Elapsed Time of Major Compaction

This section displays a bar chart of top 5 clusters with the longest major compaction time in the last three days. A major compaction merges all dynamic and static data, which is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated through minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, a major compaction of data is performed to obtain a major version.

This section is empty if no major compaction has been performed in the last three days. You can click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner to zoom in the chart for a better view.

## Server Resources

This section displays information about each IDC, including the name, total number of servers, and number of servers on which OBServer has been deployed. You can determine whether it is necessary to perform cluster scale-out based on such information.

## Resource Usage

This section displays the resource usage information of each cluster, including the cluster name, number of tenants, allocated CPU resources in percentage, allocated memory in percentage, and occupied disk space. You can sort clusters by the allocated CPU resources, allocated memory, and occupied disk space. Also, you can click the name of a cluster to go to the cluster details page.
