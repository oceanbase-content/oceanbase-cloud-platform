# Overview of the cluster details page

On the details page of a cluster, you can view its basic information, resource usage, alerts, system events in the last 7 days, zones, and OBServers, and perform routine maintenance operations.

## View the basic information

On the Overview page, you can view the basic information of the cluster in the following fields: **OceanBase Version**, **Regions**, **Deployment Mode**, **CPU Architecture**, **Servers**, **Tenants**, **Created By**, **OBProxy Cluster**, **Software Installation Path**, **Data Disk Path**, **Log Disk Path** , and **ConfigUrl** .

|  Parameter   | Description    |
|---------|--------------|
| OceanBase Version   | The OceanBase Database version of the cluster.   |
| Regions     | The number of regions in the cluster.    |
| Deployment Mode     | The deployment mode of the cluster.  The value 1 indicates that the cluster has one zone and the zone has one host.  The value 1-1 indicates that the cluster has two zones and each zone has one host.  The value N-N-...N (M Ns) indicates that the cluster has M zones and each zone has N hosts.     |
| CPU Architecture      | The CPU architecture of the host, which is automatically identified by OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) when the host is added.  When there are multiple different CPU architectures in the cluster, OCP will display all CPU architecture information.    |
| Servers    | The number of hosts in the cluster.   |
| Tenants      | The number of tenants in the cluster.     |
| Created By     | The username of the user who created the cluster.       |
| OBProxy Cluster    | The OBProxy cluster associated with the current OceanBase cluster.  <ul><li>If the cluster is not associated with an OBProxy cluster, click **Associate OBProxy Cluster** to associate it with one or more OBProxy clusters.</li><li> If the cluster is associated with OBProxy clusters, you can click the edit icon to add or delete OBProxy clusters.  </li></ul>  |
| Software Installation Path | The path was specified when the cluster was created.      |
| Data Disk Path             | The path was specified when the cluster was created.        |
| Log Disk Path              | The path was specified when the cluster was created.       |
| ConfigUrl                  | The cluster URL. You can click the copy icon to copy it.      |

## View resource usage

The Resource Usage section displays **Allocated CPU, Allocated Memory** , and **Disk Usage** . You can manage the cluster based on the resource usage.

## View system events in the last 7 days

In the **System Events in Last 7 Days** section, you can specify search criteria to view the system events generated in the last 7 days, and perform the following operations:

* Filter events by specifying the time range in the time selection field.

* Filter events in the Event Name column.

* Filter events in the Module column.

* Sort the events in ascending or descending order by the start time in the Start Time column.

The system can combine the filter conditions and list the system events you want to view.
