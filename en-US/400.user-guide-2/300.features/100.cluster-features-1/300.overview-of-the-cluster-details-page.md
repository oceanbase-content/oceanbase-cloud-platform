## Protection mode

* Maximum performance: It protects user data and maximizes the performance of the primary cluster. In this mode, the log transfer between the primary cluster and all standby clusters is asynchronous.

* Maximum availability: Normally, the primary cluster keeps synchronous log transfer with only one standby cluster.

* Maximum protection: The primary cluster keeps synchronous log transfer with only one standby cluster, and asynchronous log transfer with other standby clusters.

## Switch between clusters

To view the general information of another cluster, click the cluster name field in the upper left corner on the **Overview** page, and select the target cluster from the drop-down list.
