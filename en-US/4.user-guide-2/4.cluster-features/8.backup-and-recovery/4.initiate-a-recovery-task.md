Initiate a recovery task
=============================================

You can recover a cluster that has a backup.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* You have backed up the cluster to be recovered. For more information, see [Back up now](2.back-up.md).

* You cannot recover data for an OceanBase cluster that has been physically backed up from a later version to an earlier version.

* The cluster is not in the Running state.

* The cluster does not have a backup strategy.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Cluster Overview** page.

3. Click the target cluster in **Clusters** or **Resource Usage** to go to the O\&M page of the cluster.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Backup \& Recovery** .

5. On the **Backup \& Recovery** page of the cluster, click **Initiate Recovery** .

6. Select **Recovery Source and Time** and select the values from the drop-down list.

   |   Parameter    |                                                                        Description                                                                        |
   |----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Source Cluster | If you initiate a recovery task from the O\&M page of a cluster, the cluster is the source cluster by default, you do not need to specify this parameter. |
   | Source Tenant  | Select the tenant to recover.                                                                                                                             |
   | Recovery Date  | Select a date within the specified recoverable time range.                                                                                                |
   | Recovery Time  | Select a point in time within the specified time range.                                                                                                   |

7. Select the destination tenant of the recovery task. Select a cluster in the Running state from the drop-down list and enter the new tenant name.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The following types of clusters cannot be used as the recovery destination:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Clusters in the primary/standby mode.</li>
    <li>Clusters in the Unavailable state.</li>
    </ul>
  </main>

8. Specify the following fields in the Zone Configuration section and set the priorities of the zones.

   | Parameter | Description  |
   |-------|-----|
   | Replica Type       | Valid values: <ul><li> Full-featured Replica: A general-purpose replica that has a full set of data types and features including transaction logs, a MemTable, and an SSTable. A full-featured replica can switch to the leader role in an efficient manner to provide services.   </li><li>Log Replica: A replica that contains only logs. It does not have a MemTable or an SSTable. It provides log services for external applications and participates in log voting. It can facilitate the recovery of other replicas, but it cannot become the leader to provide database services.   </li><li> Read-only Replica: A replica that contains full logs, MemTables, and SSTables. You can select this type of replica for applications that does not require high consistency in data reading.  </li></ul>  |
   | Unit Specification | The specification of the resources that the replica occupies.  <ul><li> You can select an existing specification or   </li><li> create a specification as needed and select the new one.   </li></ul>  |
   | Units              | The amount of resource units occupied by the replica.   |
