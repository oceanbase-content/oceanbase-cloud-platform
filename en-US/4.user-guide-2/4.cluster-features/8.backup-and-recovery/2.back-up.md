# Back up now

This topic describes how to back up a cluster or a tenant immediately.

## Prerequisites

A cluster in logical backup mode supports only full backup. A cluster in physical backup mode supports both full backup and incremental backup.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** . The cluster overview page appears.

3. Find the target cluster in the **Clusters** list and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.

4. In the left-navigation pane, click **Backup \& Recovery** .

5. Click **Backup Now**.

6. Select the objects that you want to back up. Select the objects from the **Backup Cluster** drop-down list. The system automatically identifies **Data** and **Backup Method** of the cluster and automatically populates the fields of **Storage Configuration** .

7. Specify Storage Configuration.

   * If the cluster that you want to back up has a backup strategy, the fields in the Storage Configuration section are automatically populated.

   * Otherwise, you must manually specify the values. You can specify the values as prompted or by following the instructions of step 4 in [Create a backup strategy](1.create-a-backup-strategy.md).

     After you specify the values, click **Test** .

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>You must perform a full backup before you can perform an incremental backup. Otherwise, the following error message is returned in the <code>Check if ready to data backup</code> step: Full data backup needed before incremental data backup.
    If the error message &quot;Cluster compaction needed before full data backup&quot; is returned in the <code>Start cluster compact if necessary</code> step of a full backup, <a href="../7.merge-management/4.perform-merge-1.md">perform a major compaction</a> and click <strong>Retry</strong> .</p>
