# Reinstall OBServer

This topic describes how to reinstall OBServer. When you reinstall OBServer, OBServer is removed from the current host and then reinstalled. This helps you quickly rebuild a faulty OBServer.

## Prerequisites

* You have the permission to **Update** a cluster with the current account.

* Your OceanBase cluster is managed in the current OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster.

   Otherwise, you need to use the current OCP cluster to take over your OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Take over a cluster](../1.take-over-a-cluster.md).

* The host on which you will reinstall OBServer is online.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The cluster overview page appears.

3. In the **Clusters** list on this page, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.

4. In the **OBServers** list, click **Reinstall** in the Actions column of the target OBServer.

5. In the dialog box that appears, enter **reinstall** and click **Reinstall**.

   > **Note**
   >
   > * Before you confirm the reinstallation, you must confirm the information of the OBServer to be reinstalled, including the IP address, cluster, zone, and CPU architecture of the host.
   > * Reinstallation will clear all data on this OBServer. Proceed with caution.

6. Click **OK**.

7. In the dialog box that appears, you can click the task ID to view the progress of the reinstallation task.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed**, and the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page of the cluster does not contain the OBServer, the OBServer is deleted.
