# Restart an OBServer

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The cluster overview page appears.

3. On the Cluster Overview page, find the target cluster in the Clusters list and click the cluster name. The Cluster Details page appears.

5. In the dialog box that appears, select whether to force restart. A force restart directly stops the OBServer, which may bring uncertain risks to the system.

6. Click **Restart** .

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress of the task.

   When the task status is **Completed** and the status of the OBServer is **Running** in the **OBServers** list on the **Overview** page, the OBServer is restarted.
