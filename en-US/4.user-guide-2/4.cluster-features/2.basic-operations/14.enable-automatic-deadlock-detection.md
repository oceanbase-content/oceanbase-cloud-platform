# Enable automatic detection of deadlocks

You can enable the automatic detection of deadlocks based on your business requirements.

## Prerequisites

* The logged-on user has the permission to manage the cluster.

* The version of the OceanBase cluster is V3.2.0 or later, and the cluster is not in read-only mode.

* Automatic detection of deadlocks is not enabled for the cluster.

> **Note**
>
> If the version of the OceanBase Database is V4.0 and later, automatic detection of deadlocks is enabled by default. If automatic detection of deadlocks is disabled, you can use this feature to enable it.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. Click the **More** icon in the upper right corner on the **Overview** page, and select **Enable Automatic Deadlock Detection** from the context menu.

5. Click **OK** in the dialog box that appears.

   After automatic detection of deadlocks is enabled, OceanBase Database automatically detects and rolls back deadlocks. The deadlocks of the last 7 days are retained. For more information, see [View deadlock analysis](../../5.tenant-functions/13.session-management/3.view-deadlock-analysis.md).

> Automatic detection of deadlocks consumes approximately 2% of the system resources. Proceed with caution.
