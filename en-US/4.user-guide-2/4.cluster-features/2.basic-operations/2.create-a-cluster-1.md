# Create a cluster

You can create the primary cluster or a standby cluster based on your business needs.

## Prerequisites

* You are logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console with an account that has the permission to **create clusters**.

* Optional. An OBProxy cluster exists in OCP. This is required if you want to create a multi-replica OceanBase cluster. For more information about how to create an OBProxy cluster, visit the following links: [Create an OBProxy cluster](../../8.obproxy/1.create-an-obproxy-cluster-2.md)

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console, and find the entry to cluster creation based on the actual business scenario.

   1. If you do not have a manageable cluster, the system displays a message on the **Clusters** page, prompting you to create one. Click **Create Cluster** in the prompt.

   2. If you already have a manageable cluster, go to the **Clusters** page, and then click **Create Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Create Cluster** page, configure the basic information of the cluster.

      The following table describes the fields on the Basic Information page.

      | Field | Description   |
      |---------|---------|
      | **Cluster Type** | Select **Primary Cluster**.    |
      | **Cluster Name** | The name of the cluster to be created. The cluster name must be 2 to 48 characters in length and can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_). The cluster name must start with letters.    |
      | **Root@sys Password** | This password can be customized or randomly generated.  The password must meet the following complexity conditions:<ul><li>The length is 8 to 32 characters.</li><li>The password contains at least two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, two digits, and two special characters. </li><li>The supported special characters are ~ ! @ # % \ ^ & * _ - + = `   | ( ) { } [ ] : ; ' , . ? /  </li></ul> |
      | **OceanBase Version** | You can select an OceanBase cluster version from the drop-down list or click **Add Version** at the bottom of the list to upload an OceanBase Database version.    |
      | **Associate OBProxy Cluster** | Allows you to associate the cluster with an OBProxy cluster. If you want to create a multi-replica OceanBase cluster, we recommend that you turn on this option and select an existing OBProxy cluster to associate it with the cluster.  After the association, the SQL requests of your business will be accurately forwarded to a replica. This ensures good experience that can rival access to a standalone database when you access an OceanBase database.  </br>1. By default, the proxyro user is used for association. You do not need to enter a username or password.  </br>2. Select the OBProxy cluster for association from the drop-down list. If no OBProxy cluster is available in the drop-down list, create an OBProxy cluster. For more information, see the **Prerequisites** of this topic. <blockquote>**Notice**</br><ul><li>If the selected cluster version in the **OceanBase Version** field is V4.0 or later, only OBProxy clusters of V4.0.0 or later can be associated. </li><li>The password of the proxyro user of the OBProxy cluster to be associated must be the same as that of the OceanBase cluster. Otherwise, the OBProxy cluster cannot be associated. </li></ul></blockquote> |

3. Set the deployment mode of the cluster.

   By default, three zones are added for a cluster. To deploy more than three zones for the cluster, click **Add**. To deploy less than three zones for the cluster, click the Delete icon after the zone to be deleted.

   The following table describes the settings for each zone.

   | Field | Description |
   |-----|-------|
   | **Zone Name** | You can retain the default name or define a custom name.  A zone name must consist of 2 to 48 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_), and start with a letter.  In an OceanBase cluster that consists of multiple zones, you must have a zone that shares the same region as that of the primary zone.  |
   | **IDC** | The IDC of the zone. Each zone can be deployed in only one IDC.  |
   | **Host Type** | Optional.  If you select a host type, the host list is filtered based on the host type.  |
   | **CPU Architecture** | If multiple installation packages with different architectures are available for the selected OceanBase Database version, the selected hardware architecture of the host must match the software package. <blockquote>**Notice**</br><ul><li>By default, the architecture of the first installation package is used. You can change the architecture. After you change the architecture, you can select a host of the selected architecture from the drop-down list of the **Host** column. </li><li>You can set different architectures for the zones. However, the deployment mode with a hybrid architecture may have stability and performance issues. Proceed with caution. </li></blockquote> |
   | **Host** | You can select or add hosts.  |
   | **Root Server** | You can select an IP address as the host for the RootService. If you want to create a multi-replica OceanBase cluster, you must specify this parameter for each zone.  |
   | **Zone Priority Rankings**  | The priorities of the zones. The zone with the highest priority is taken as the primary zone. Only one primary zone is allowed.  Ranking method:</br> 1. Select one or more zones from the left-side list.  The left-side list shows all zones available in the cluster. </br>2. Click the closing angle bracket (>) in the middle.  The selected zones are moved to the **Priority Rankings** list. The zones that are selected at the same time have the same priority.  </br>3. Repeat steps a and b to add zones of lower priority. </br>4. You can drag a zone in the **Priority Rankings** list to adjust its priority.  The priority in the list decreases from top to bottom.  |

4. In the **Parameter Configurations** section, configure the cluster parameters.

   * You can add startup parameters one by one and set values as shown in section ① of the following figure.

   * You can also click **Select Parameter Template** as shown in section ② of the following figure and select a parameter template. The system will automatically populate parameters in this section by using the template.

      > **Note**
      >
      > * If you use OceanBase Database V2.2.77, we recommend that you use the built-in **2.2.77 Version Parameter Template**. This template contains general parameters of OceanBase Database V2.2.77. You can configure a cluster based on this template.
      > * If no cluster parameter template is available, you can click **Create Cluster Template** to create one. For more information, see [Manage cluster parameter templates](../12.cluster-parameter-template-management.md).

5. Turn on **Custom Settings** to configure paths and ports.

   * Configure the paths:
      1. In the **Path Settings** section, specify the **Software Installation Path, Data Disk Path**, and **Log Disk Path** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the paths can be used. If a path cannot be used, you can perform troubleshooting based on the test results, or use another path.

   * Configure the ports:
      3. In the **Port Settings** section, specify **SQL Port** and **RPC Port** as needed.
      4. Click **Test** to check whether the ports are occupied. If a port is occupied, you must use another port.

6. After the test succeeds, click **Submit**.

7. In the **Confirm Information** dialog box, confirm the information and then click **OK**.

   You can also choose **System Management > Tasks** to view the progress of the task.
