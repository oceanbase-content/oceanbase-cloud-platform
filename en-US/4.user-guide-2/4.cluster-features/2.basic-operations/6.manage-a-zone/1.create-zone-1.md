3. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page, click **Create Zone** .

5. In the dialog box that appears, set the zone information.

   By default, only one zone is added at a time.To add more zones, click **Add** .

   > **Note**
   >
   > The hardware architecture of the hosts in the zone must be the same as that of the cluster.

   The following table describes the parameters required for setting the zone information.

   |    **Field**     |                                                                                                                                                                    **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    |
   |------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Zone Name        | Specifies the name of the zone.       |
   | IDC              | Specifies the IDC where the zone is located.     |
   | Host Type        | Optional.  If you select a host type, the host list is filtered based on the host type.         |
   | Selection Method | Choose **Automatic** or **Manual** .      |
   | CPU Architecture | The hardware architecture of the CPU in the zone must be the same as that of the cluster. After selecting the specified architecture, the system will check whether there is an installation package that matches the current cluster CPU architecture. When the installation package for the specified architecture is missing, you will not be able to add a Zone.  |
   | Host             | You can select multiple IP addresses.  If **Selection Method** is set to **Automatic** , you only need to enter the number of hosts, and OCP automatically selects the specified number of hosts from the available hosts. If **Selection Method** is set to **Manual** , you need to manually select the IP addresses from the list. |

6. Click **OK** .
