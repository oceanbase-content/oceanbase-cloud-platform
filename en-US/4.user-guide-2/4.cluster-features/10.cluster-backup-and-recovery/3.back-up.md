Back up now
================================

This topic describes how to back up a cluster or a tenant immediately.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

The OceanBase cluster is not in **upgrading** state.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**. The cluster overview page appears.

3. Find the target cluster in the **Clusters** list and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the cluster.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery** .

5. Click **Back up Now** in the upper-right corner of the page .

6. Check the objects that you want to back up.

    The system automatically identifies **OceanBase Version**, **Backup Cluster** and **Backup Method** of the cluster and automatically populates the fields of **Storage Configuration** .

7. Specify Storage Configuration.

   * If the cluster that you want to back up has a backup strategy, the fields in the Storage Configuration section are automatically populated.

   * Otherwise, you must manually specify the values. You can specify the values as prompted or by following the instructions of **Create Backup Strategy** in [Create a backup strategy](2.create-a-backup-strategy.md).

     After you specify the values, click **Test** .

8. Select a data backup mode.

   For physical backup, select a data backup mode. For logical backup, only full backup is supported.

   > **Notice**
   >
   > * You must perform a full backup before you can perform an incremental backup. Otherwise, the following error message is returned in the `Check if ready to data backup` step: Full data backup needed before incremental data backup.
   > * If the error message "Cluster compaction needed before full data backup" is returned in the `Start cluster compact if necessary` step of a full backup, [Perform a major compaction](../9.merge-management/4.perform-merge-1.md) and click **Retry** .

9. Click **Back up Now** .
