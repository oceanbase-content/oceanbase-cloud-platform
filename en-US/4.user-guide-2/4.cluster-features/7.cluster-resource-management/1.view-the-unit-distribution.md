# View unit distribution

You can view the unit distribution to check the physical distribution and resource usage of each tenant in OceanBase clusters.

The Unit Distribution page provides the **Unit View** and **Replica View** tabs.

In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** . In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name. The Overview page of the cluster appears. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resource Management** . The **Unit Distribution** page automatically appears.

> **Notice**
>
> If the version of the OceanBase Database is V4.0 and later, will be not support viewing the **Replica View**.

## Unit View

The **Unit View** tab automatically appears. It displays the distribution of units in the unit view, where each column indicates one OBServer.

* Click **Tenant** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select a tenant.

* Click **Region** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select the physical region where the current cluster is located.

* Click **Zone** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select Zone1, Zone2, or Zone3.

* Click **Type** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select the host type.

* Enable **Real-time Refresh** . The unit view refreshes every one second so that you can view the latest unit distribution.

  * Check load balancing of the cluster:

    You can view the values of **Allocated Memory** , **Allocated CPU** , and **Used Disks** of each zone to check whether the usage of the same type of resource is balanced across the servers in the zone. If not, you can modify the load balancing parameters of the OceanBase cluster to implement load balancing.

  * Evaluate whether the cluster needs to scale out:

    You may consider a cluster scale-out when the value of **Used Disks** reaches 80%.

  * View the resource distribution of a tenant:

    You can click **Tenant** in the upper-right corner of the tab, select the target tenant from the drop-down list, and then click **OK** to view the resource distribution of the tenant.

  * View tenant details:

    Click the name of a tenant in the view to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant. On this page, you can view the tenant details, including the replica details, zone priority, and whitelist information.

  * Manually implement load balancing:

    If the built-in load balancing algorithms of the OceanBase cluster cannot meet your needs, you can click a unit card next to the tenant to manually migrate resources, but only within a single zone.

    > **Note**
    >
    > We recommend that you disable the automatic load balancing feature of the OceanBase cluster before you manually implement load balancing, because the feature may migrate the unit back to the original locality.

> **Note**
>
> The **Number of Units** row displays the number of units in the cluster. If the number of units is greater than the number of tenants, units that are not associated with a tenant exist. You can delete or compact the units that have been idle for more than one hour.

## Replica View

Click the **Replica View** tab to view the distribution of replicas in the replica view, where each column indicates one OBServer.

* Click **Tenant** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select a tenant.

* Click **Region** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select the physical region where the current cluster is located.

* Click **Zone** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select Zone1, Zone2, or Zone3.

* Click **Type** in the upper-right corner of the tab to select the host type.

* Enable **Real-time Refresh** . The replica view refreshes every 30 seconds so that you can view the latest unit distribution.

  * Check load balancing of the cluster:

    You can view the values of **Allocated Memory** , **Allocated CPU** , and **Used Disks** of each zone to check whether the usage of the same type of resource is balanced across the hosts in the zone. If not, you can modify the load balancing parameters of the OceanBase cluster to implement load balancing.

  * Evaluate whether the cluster needs to scale out:

    You may consider a cluster scale-out when the value of **Used Disks** reaches 80%.

  * View the resource distribution of a tenant:

    You can click **Tenant** in the upper-right corner of the tab, select the target tenant from the drop-down list, and then click **OK** to view the resource distribution of the tenant.

    Hover the cursor over the replica card next to the tenant to view the number of leader replicas and the total number of replicas of the tenant.

  * View tenant details:

    Click the name of a tenant in the view to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant. On this page, you can view the tenant details, including the replica details, zone priority, and whitelist information.

  * Stop or start an OBServer:

    Click the host card next to a host address to start or stop the OBServer.

    > **Notice**
    >
    > Stopping an OBServer will switch all its traffic and the leader role to another OBServer. Proceed with caution.
