# Perform a major compaction

You can immediately trigger a major compaction for a cluster in the idle state. When an error occurs during the major compaction of the cluster, you can perform troubleshooting, clear the error, and then continue the major compaction.

## Trigger a major compaction

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   The **Clusters** page automatically appears.

2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management**.

4. On the **Details of Major Compaction** tab, view the major compaction information in the **Basic Information** section.

5. After you confirm that the cluster is in the **Idle** state, click **Initiate Major Compaction**. The system will initiate a major compaction for all tenants in the cluster.

6. If the status is **Tenant major compaction in progress**, you can click **View Tenants** to view the tenants that are in the progress of the major compaction.

## Continue the major compaction

When an error occurs during the major compaction of the tenants, you can click **View Tenants** to locate the faulty tenant.
After you perform troubleshooting, click **Clear Exceptions** to clear the error flag and continue the major compaction.

> **Notice**
>
> When an error occurs during a major compaction, we recommend that you contact a professional to verify the problem. If you clear the error flag without troubleshooting the error, the error scope may expand.
