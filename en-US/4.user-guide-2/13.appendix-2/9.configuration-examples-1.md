# Examples of alert channel configuration

This topic provides examples of alert channel configuration for your reference.

## DingTalk alert channel

You can send group messages based on the webhook of a DingTalk group chatbot. To configure a DingTalk alert channel, perform the following two operations:

* Configure a chatbot for the DingTalk group for receiving alert notifications.
* Configure a DingTalk alert channel in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

### Configure a chatbot for a DingTalk group

1. Open the DingTalk group for receiving alert notifications on your computer.

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Group Settings**.

3. In the panel that appears, choose **Group Assistant > Add Robot**.

4. In the **ChatBot** dialog box, click ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/401/%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE%E5%9B%BE%E6%A0%871.png) and select the chatbot that you want to add.

5. Click **Custom**. In the **Robot details** dialog box, click **Add**.

6. In the **Add Robot** dialog box, specify **Chatbot name** and **Security Settings**.

   Options for **Security Settings** include **Custom Keywords**, **Additional Signature**, and **IP Address**. Select one of them as needed. For more information, see [Custom chatbot security settings](https://open.dingtalk.com/document/robots/customize-robot-security-settings). In this example, select **Custom Keywords**.

7. Select **I have read and accepted DingTalk Custom Robot Service Terms of Service** and click **Finished**.

8. In the **Add Robot** dialog box, copy the webhook URL of the chatbot and click **Finished**.

### Configure a DingTalk alert channel

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Alerts**.

3. On the **Alert Channels** tab, click **Create Channel**.

4. Specify the fields in the **Basic Information** section of the channel.

   | Field | Description |
   |------|-------|
   | Channel Type | Select **DingTalk**.  |
   | Channel Name | The name of the alert channel.  |
   | Webhook URL | The webhook URL generated after you configure the DingTalk chatbot, which is the URL that you copied in **Step 8** in the **Configure a chatbot for a DingTalk group** section. |
   | Signature Key | Optional. The signature key obtained after you select **Additional Signature** for **Security Settings**. |
   | Specified User | Optional. The phone number of a DingTalk group member.  |
   | Proxy | Optional. Specify the proxy server that sends alerts, in the format of `http:ip:port`. In the format, `ip` represents the IP address of the proxy server, and `port` represents the port that is assigned to send alerts.  For example, if the IP address of the proxy server is xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and port 80 is assigned, you can set **Proxy** to `http:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80`. |

5. (Optional) Configure alert messages for the channel

   DingTalk supports messages in the Markdown format. The following example uses Markdown to format rich-text messages.  Except for several templates, the rich-text messages are configured in the same way as the text messages.  For example, you can change the font color for messages by referencing `${alarm_level_color}`.

   For more information about the message types supported by DingTalk, see [DingTalk Developer Guide](https://open-doc.dingtalk.com/microapp/serverapi2/ye8tup#-6).

         * Message template
    
        ```javascript
        <font color=${alarm_level_color}>OCP Alert Notification - Single Alert</font>
        > - Name: `${alarm_name}`
         > - Level: `${alarm_level}`
         > - Alert object: `${alarm_target}
          > - Summary: '${alarm_summary}'
         > - Generation time: '${alarm_active_at}'
         > - Description: `${alarm_description}`
         > - [View in OCP](${alarm_url})
          ```
    
        * Message aggregation template
    
          ```javascript
          <font color=${alarm_level_color}>OCP Alert Notification - Multiple Alerts</font>
          > - Name: `${alarm_name}`
          > - Level: `${alarm_level}`
          > - Alerts: '${alarm_count}'
          > - Aggregation group: '${alarm_group_by}'
          > - Alert object: `${alarm_target}
          > - Generation time: '${alarm_active_at}'
          ```
    
        * Body template
    
          ```javascript
          {
              "msgtype": "markdown",
              "markdown": {
                  "title": "DingTalk OCP alert message Markdown formatting test",
                  "text": ${message_json}
              }
          }
          ```
    
          ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/401/%E9%92%89%E9%92%89%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE1.png)

6. Click **Send Test Message**.

7. If the message is sent, click **Submit**.

## Custom script channel

The custom script channel is designed for special scenarios. It is typically used when you cannot configure alerts in the HTTP channel or you have special alert format requirements. You can customize some special logic in the script. For example, you can customize a script channel to change the alert time or add default variables to third-party alert gateways.

* **Basic Information**: Select **Custom Script** for **Channel Type**, and set other options as needed.

* Message template

   ```javascript
   OCP Alert Notification - Single Alert
   - Name: ${alarm_name}
   - Level: ${alarm_level}
   - Alert object: ${alarm_target}
   - Summary: ${alarm_summary}
   - Generation time: ${alarm_active_at}
   - Description: ${alarm_description}
   - OCP URL: ${alarm_url}
   ```

* Message aggregation template

   ```javascript
   OCP Alert Notification - Multiple Alerts
   - Name: ${alarm_name}
   - Level: ${alarm_level}
   - Alerts: ${alarm_count}
   - Aggregation group: ${alarm_group_by}
   - Alert object: ${alarm_target}
   - Generation time: ${alarm_active_at}
   ```

* Script file name: The system provides a default custom script sample `alarm_send_script_demo.sh`. You can modify this script or refer to **Python script example** and **Bash script example** to create custom scripts. When you modify or create a script, make sure that the script file is stored in the `/home/admin` directory of each OCP.

* Send test messages: When you debug a script, you can send a test message for testing. By default, the message contains the variable `${message}` in the script. Make sure that the variable is included in the body of the message sent. The logic for determining whether a custom script is sent depends on the actual situation. The system determines that a script is sent as long as it is executed. However, in the developer mode of your browser, you can debug a script based on the response to the _test request of the test message sent.

### Python script example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Note: The first line of the script must use a shebang to specify the program to use. Only Python and bash are supported.

import json
import requests
import os
import sys

ACCESS_TOKEN = "Ding Talk Token"

def send_alarm():
    """
    You can use the os.environ function to obtain the values of alert-related variables from environment variables.
    For more information about the supported variables, see Appendix 4 OCP alert template variables in the OCP User Guide.
    """
    message = os.environ['message']
    data = {
        "msgtype": "markdown",
        "markdown": {
            "text": message
        }
    }
    resp = requests.post("https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send?access_token=" + ACCESS_TOKEN, json=data)
    resp.close()
    response = json.loads(resp.text)

    # Output the response to the standard error (stderr) or standard output (stdout) to verify whether the alert is successfully sent. stderr is verified first.
    if not response['errcode'] == 0:
        sys.stderr.write(resp.text)
    else:
        print(resp.text)

def main():
    """
    Return 0 if succeeded.
    Return a non-zero value if failed. The error is printed to stderr.
    """
    try:
        send_alarm()
        return 0
    except Exception as e:
        sys.stderr.write(str(e))
        return 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main())
```

### Bash script example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# should contain shebang in the first line. Only python/bash are supported.

# This function defines to how to assemble custom requests.
# This demo shows you how to send alerts to DingTalk.
function send() {
    # This token is a DingTalk group token. You need to apply and assign it to a variable token.
    token='Ding Talk Token'
    URL="https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send?access_token=$token"

    # if message is json format, use "'"${message}"'" or "${message}", do not wrapper a new json body
    # if message is not json format, use "${message}"
    # do not use '${message}'
    # print the response to stderr or stdout, which will be validated if success, validate stderr firstly.
    curl -s -X POST ${URL} -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"msgtype":"text","text":{"content":"'"${message}"'"}}'

    return $?
}

# invoke function to
send
```

> **Note**
>
> The following shebangs are supported: python, bash, sh, /bin/bash, /bin/sh, /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/bash, /usr/bin/env python, and /usr/bin/env.
> The correct writing of a bash shebang is `#!/bin/sh`. We recommend that you use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. The first matching command will be found in $PATH for execution.
