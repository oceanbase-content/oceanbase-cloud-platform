# View SQL statement details

This topic describes how to view details of an SQL statement in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), including its execution status, execution plans, bound indexes, and throttling enabling status.

## Prerequisites

* The version of OceanBase Database is later than 3.0 so that you can view the SQL statement execution profile.

* For a tenant in MySQL mode, the password box of the OCP user must contain the password of the tenant.

* For a tenant in Oracle mode, the password box of the OCP user must contain the password of the SYS tenant in the cluster.

   On the **SQL Details** page, you can view the following details of the SQL statement:

   * In the **SQL Text** section, you can view the complete SQL statement. OCP masks sensitive data in the SQL statement. However, if OCP failed to parse the SQL statement, it returns the original SQL statement.

   * On the **Previous Tendency** tab, you can view the historical trends of the SQL statement. For more information, see **View the historical trends of an SQL statement**.

   * On the **Execution Plans** tab, you can view the execution plans of the SQL statement. For more information, see **View the execution plans of an SQL statement**.

   * On the **Index** tab, you can view the indexes bound to the SQL statement. For more information, see **View and bind indexes**.

## View the historical trends of an SQL statement

On the **SQL Details** page, click the **Previous Tendency** tab.

You can view the SQL Statement Execution and SQL Plan Generation Time charts on this tab. When you modify the statistical time in section ① of the figure, both of the charts will be updated based on the new time.
