   | Replica Type | Valid values: <ul><li>**Full-featured Replica**: A standard replica type that contains all the data categories and all the features, including MemTables, SSTables, and transaction logs. A full-featured replica can switch to the leader role in an efficient manner to provide services. </li><li>**Log Replica**: A replica that contains only logs. It does not have a MemTable or an SSTable. It provides log services for external applications and participates in log voting. It can facilitate the recovery of other replicas, but it cannot become the leader to provide database services.    </li><li>**Read-only Replica**: A replica that contains full logs, MemTables, and SSTables. You can select this type of replica for applications that does not require high consistency in data reading.  </li></ul> |
