# Create a backup strategy

You can create backup strategies for tenants that need to be backed up. After you create a backup strategy, you can view the backup status of the tenant on the Tenant Overview Overview page.

## Prerequisites

You can create backup strategies only for OceanBase Database tenants whose version is V4.0 or later.

## Procedure

OCP allows you to configure personalized backup and restoration policies based on the tenant dimension. After you create a tenant-level backup strategy for a tenant, the tenant is no longer affected by the cluster-level backup strategy.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If a cluster-level backup strategy exists in the cluster to which the tenant belongs, the cluster-level backup strategy content is filled by default when you create a tenant-level backup strategy.</p>
  </main>

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**.
   The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Backup & Recovery**.

4. On the **Backup & Recovery** page, click **Create Tenant Backup Strategy**.

5. Specify the following storage configuration parameters and click **Test**.

      | Field | Description |
      |-----|---|
      | Storage Configuration Name | You can configure a custom configuration or select an existing configuration.  <ul><li>For a custom configuration, specify the following fields. </li><li> If you select an existing configuration, click **Select Existing Configuration**. Then, the system automatically populates the following fields. </li></ul> |
      | Storage Type | The type of storage media for backup files. File: Your local file storage system. Generally, Network File System (NFS) is used.  |
      | Storage Directory | The directory in which the backup files are stored on the media.   <blockquote>**Note**</br>If you have configured a backup strategy for the cluster to which the tenant belongs, we recommend that you specify the same storage directory as that of the cluster. Otherwise, the backup statistics of the tenant will be affected. </blockquote> |
      | Alert Threshold for Backup Storage Capacity | The default threshold is 80%. An alert is triggered when the utilization of the backup storage reaches this threshold.  |

6. Specify fields in the Scheduling Settings section:

   * Scheduling Cycle: If you set the scheduling cycle to one month, the maximum value of this parameter is 10 days.

   * If you need to perform physical backups, log backup must be enabled.

8. Specify alert thresholds. You can specify the timeout threshold for data backup tasks, alert threshold for log backup delays, and alert threshold for the number of days without successful data backup. After you set a threshold, an alert is triggered when the threshold is reached.
