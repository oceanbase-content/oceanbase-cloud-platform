Before you recover a tenant, you need to back up the tenant or its cluster.

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the Tenant Overview page.

2. Find the target tenant in the Tenants list, and click its name. In the left-side navigation pane of the **Tenant Overview** page, click **Backup and Recovery**.

3. On the Backup and Recovery page, you can perform the following operations:

   * Click **Initiate Recovery** to recover the tenant. For more information, see [Initiate a recovery](4.initiate-a-tenant-recovery-task.md).

   * Click **Back up Now** to back up the tenant. For more information, see [Back up now](3.back-up-now.md).

    <p>Tenant backup is not supported in an OceanBase Database version earlier than V3.2.2-20220304134610.</p>
    </main>

   * If no backup strategy is created for the tenant, click **Create Tenant-level Backup Strategy** to create one. For more information, see [Create a backup strategy](2.create-a-tenant-backup-strategy.md).

   * If no backup strategy is created for the cluster, click **Create Cluster-level Backup Strategy** to create one. For more information, see [Create a backup strategy](2.create-a-tenant-backup-strategy.md).

   * If a tenant-level backup strategy has been created for the tenant, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and select **Edit Tenant-level Backup Strategy** to modify the backup strategy. For information about the backup strategy parameters, see [Create a backup strategy](2.create-a-tenant-backup-strategy.md).

   * If a tenant-level backup strategy has been created for the tenant, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and select **Delete Tenant-level Backup Strategy** to delete the backup strategy.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>After you delete a tenant-level backup strategy, the system uses the cluster-level backup strategy of the cluster to which the tenant belongs by default.</p>
    </main>

   * If a backup strategy has been created for the tenant, click **Pause Backup Scheduling** to pause the scheduling of automatic backup tasks for the tenant. After that, you can click **Enable Backup Scheduling** to resume the scheduling of automatic backup tasks again.
