# Create a tenant

A tenant can be seen as a container for database objects and resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O resources. You can create tenants in a cluster as needed the following ways:

* Create a tenant on the **Tenant Overview** page.

* Create a tenant on the **Tenant Management** page of the specified cluster.

This topic describes how to create a tenant on the **Tenant Management** page of the specified cluster.

## Prerequisites

* The cluster where you want to create the tenant is the running primary cluster.

* The logged-on user has the permission to manage the cluster, for example, the user is the system administrator or the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) tenant administrator.

* (Optional) You have created a parameter template by referring to [Manage tenant parameter templates](../14.tenant-parameter-template-management.md).

   When you need to create multiple tenants with the same parameter configuration, you can use a parameter template to avoid repeatedly configuring the same parameters.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Tenant Management**.

5. In the upper-right corner of the page that appears, click **Create Tenant**.

6. Specify the parameters in the **Basic Information** section. The required fields and their descriptions are listed in the following table.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |---------------|---|
   | **Cluster** | The cluster to which the tenant belongs. The default value is the current cluster. <blockquote>**Note** </br>When you create a tenant on the **Tenant Overview** page, you must specify the cluster of the tenant. </blockquote> |
   | **Tenant Mode** | Valid values: `MySQL` . |
   | **Tenant Name** | The tenant name must be 2 to 64 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_).  |
   | **Administrator Password** | The password of the tenant administrator account, which can be randomly generated.  <ul><li> The administrator account is `root` in MySQL mode.    </li></ul>   The password must meet the following requirements:<ul><li>The length is 8 to 32 characters.</li><li>The password contains at least two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, two digits, and two special characters. </li><li>The supported special characters are ~ ! @ # % \ ^ & * _ - + = ` |
   | **Character Set and Encoding** | In MySQL mode, the supported character sets are UTF8MB4, Binary, GBK, and GB18030. Default value: `UTF8MB4`.    |
   | **Collation** | The detailed collation corresponding to the specified character set.  |
   | **Remarks** | This field is optional, and allows you to add additional information.  |

7. Specify the parameters in the **Replica Settings** section.

   * If the version of the specified cluster is V4.0 or later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones, which is 1 by default.

   ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE.png)

   * If the version of the specified cluster is earlier than V4.0, you can set different numbers of units for different zones.

   By default, the system displays configurable zones based on the zone information of the selected cluster. If you do not need to create a replica in a zone, click the **Delete** icon to delete the zone. The zone information fields that need to be configured and their descriptions are listed in the following table.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |----------------|------|
   | **Replica Type** | The type of the replica. Valid values: <ul><li>Full-featured replicas</li><li> Read-only replicas   </li><li> Log-only replicas</li></ul>    Select multiple full-featured replicas to ensure that they are in the majority.  |
   | **Unit Specification** | OCP has a set of built-in unit specifications. You can select the specification that you need from the list of unit specifications or click **[Add Specification](../../13.appendix-2/3.ocp-resource-unit-specifications.md)** at the bottom of the list to add a custom specification. For more information, see **OCP resource unit specifications**. |
   | **Units** | The number of units in the zone. The number of resource units cannot exceed the number of OBServers in the zone.  |
   | **Zone Priority Rankings** | The priorities of the zones. This priority order affects the priority order of the primary zone of the sys tenant.  The left-side list shows all zones in the cluster.  You can select one or more zones from the list box on the left to add them to the list box on the right. By default, the priority of a zone selected earlier is higher than that of a zone selected later, and the zones selected at one time have the same priority.  After you move the zones to the box on the right side, you can also drag them upward or downward to adjust their priority order. A zone takes priority over those beneath it. |

8. Specify the parameters in the **Security Settings** section.
   You can select **Access from all IP addresses is supported** or **Custom** for **IP Address Whitelist**.

   * If you select **Access from all IP addresses is supported**, all IP addresses are allowed.
  
      > **Note**
      >
      > There are access security risks, please operate with caution.

   * If you select **Custom**, you need to specify a list of clients that are allowed to access this tenant. The default value is **%**, which indicates that all client connections are allowed.  When you configure the whitelist, you must add the IP addresses of the OCP and OBProxy servers to it. Otherwise, you cannot manage the tenant from OCP.  Configure the whitelist in the following formats:
      * IP address example: xxx.xxx.xxx.1, xxx.xxx.xxx.2.
      * Subnet mask example: xxx.xxx.xxx.0/24.
      * Fuzzy match example: xxx.xxx.xxx.% or xxx.xxx.xxx._.
      * Mixed format example: xxx.xxx.xxx.1, xxx.xxx.xxx.2, xxx.xxx.xxx.%, xxx.xxx.xxx._, xxx.xxx.xxx.0/24.

   > **Notice**
   >
   > You must add the IP addresses of the OCP and OBProxy servers to the whitelist. Otherwise, you cannot manage the tenant from OCP.

9. Turn on the **Parameter Configurations** switch and configure the tenant parameters.

   * You can add startup parameters one by one and set values as shown in section ① of the following figure.

   * You can also move the pointer over **Select Parameter Template** as shown in section ② of the following figure, and select a parameter template. The system will automatically populate parameters in this section by using the template.

      If you are creating a tenant in MySQL mode by using a parameter template that contains parameters that are valid only in Oracle mode, you must manually delete those parameters.

10. Click **Submit**.
      The page that appears prompts you that the tenant creation task has been submitted and displays the summary information of the task.

    * To view the task details, click **View Task Details**.
    * To return to the **Tenants** list, click **Return to Tenants List**. In the **Tenants** list, you can view the status and task details of the new tenant, and delete the tenant if the tenant creation failed.
