Create an OBProxy cluster
==============================================

You can create an OBProxy cluster and enter the basic information, deployment mode, and advanced settings. Then, you can add OBProxy instances to the cluster and connect to OceanBase clusters.

Prerequisite
---------------------------------

You have the OBPROXY_MANAGER role or the permissions to manage OBProxy.

**Procedure**
----------------------------------

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** to go to the OBProxy page.

3. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Create OBProxy Cluster** .

4. On the **Create OBProxy Cluster** page, specify the following information:

   1. Refer to the following table to specify **Basic Information** .

      |           Parameter           |   Description   |
      |-------------------------------|----------------|
      | Cluster Name                  | You can customize the cluster name. The value must start with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_).    |
      | Access URL                    | The URL of the OBProxy cluster. For a virtual IP (VIP) address, you apply for the VIP and bind it to the OBProxy server.        |
      | Access Port Number            | The default port is 2883. You must enter the actual port number.      |
      | Enter the password of the proxyro user.            | The proxyro user is used to access the OceanBase cluster from the OBProxy. If the password is not specified, the default password of the proxyro user is used. The password format requirements are as follows: <ul><li>The length is 8 ~ 32 characters.</li><li>Only contain letters, numbers and special characters `~!@#%^&*_-+=|(){}[]:;,.?/`.</li><li>Contain at least 2 of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. </li><ul>     |
      | OBLB Service  | After load balancing management is enabled, you can configure OBLB to improve the load balancing capability of an OBProxy cluster.<ul><li>OBLB Service: You can select the OBLB service configured when OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) is deployed or click **Add OBLB Service**, and then add the OBLB service on the right-side pane. For more information, see **Add a load balancer** in [Manage load balancing](2.1.obproxy-load-balancing.md).<ul><li>OBLB Service Address: the address of the OBLB service. </li><li>OBLB Service Port: the port of the OBLB service. The default service port is 9090. You can change the service port as needed. </li><li>Username & Password: the username and password of the OBLB service, which are used to get the authentication information about the OBLB interface.</li></ul></li><li>VIP: the virtual IP address of the OBLB service. </li><li>Access Port: The default access port is 2883. You can change the access port. </li><li>Domain Name Configuration (optional): the configuration that points to the VIP and port. The platform does not provide the mappings between VIPs and domain names. You must configure the domain name resolution service. </li></ul><blockquote>**Note**</br>The Server Load Balancer (SLB) service applies only to the Apsara Stack environment. We recommend that you contact Technical Support for assistance. </blockquote> |
      | Access URL       | This option will be displayed when the load balancing management is closed. It is the access address of the OBProxy cluster. It is only used to generate the connection string of the tenant and does not affect the actual use. You need to configure the load balancing independently. If it is a VIP address, you need to apply for it yourself Bind to OBProxy Server.  |
      | Access Port       | This option will be displayed when the load balancing management is disabled. The default is 2883, which needs to be filled in according to the real port of the VIP.  |
      | Startup Method                | The startup method of the OBProxy cluster. Valid values: <ul><li>ConfigUrl: specifies the multi-cluster startup method, where the OBProxy cluster can access multiple OceanBase clusters.  </li><li> RsList: specifies the single cluster startup method, where the OBProxy cluster can only access the OceanBase cluster specified when the OBProxy cluster is created. After an OBProxy cluster is created, no more connectable OceanBase clusters can be added.  </li></ul>      |
      | Connectable OceanBase Cluster | Specifies OceanBase clusters that are accessible to the OBProxy cluster.  <ul><li> This field is optional when **Startup Method** is ConfigUrl. After the cluster is created, you can click [Add Connectable OceanBase Cluster](10.add-a-connectable-ob-cluster.md) to add more OceanBase clusters.   </li><li> You must specify the value of this field when **Startup Method** is RsList.  Select the OceanBase cluster from the drop-down list.  </li><li> If the password box contains the credentials of the proxyro user of the cluster, the proxyro user is selected by default.   </li><li> Otherwise, click **Create Connection** to create a connection credential for the proxyro user of the cluster. </li></ul>     |

   2. (Optional) Configure fields of the **Deploy OBProxy** page.

      You can deploy OBProxy when creating an OBProxy cluster. Otherwise, you can skip this step. After the cluster is created, you can add OBProxy to the cluster by taking the following actions: [Take over OBProxy](2.obproxy-3.md) or [Add OBProxy](6.add-obproxy.md).
      1. Toggle on the switch in the upper-right corner of the **Deploy OBProxy** page.

      2. Refer to the following table to specify the fields.

         |         Parameter          |     Description         |
         |----------------------------|-----------|
         | SQL Port Number            | The default port is 2883.           |
         | Exporter Port Number       | The default port is 2884.         |
         | Software Version           | Select the version of OBProxy RPM to install.  <blockquote> **Notice** <br> If the version of the OceanBase Database is V4.0 and later in **Connectable OceanBase Cluster**, only the OBProxy software package of V4.0.0 and later can be selected.</blockquote>                                                                                                    |
         | Fields about OBProxy Hosts | Configure the host where OBProxy is deployed by specifying the following fields: IDC, Host Type (Optional), Selection Method, and Host IP Address. |

         * To deploy more hosts, click **Add OBProxy** to add a host.

         * If you need to deploy only one OBProxy host, click the delete icon next to the Host IP Address field to delete the host.

   3. Enable **Advanced Settings** to add or modify startup parameters and other parameters. For more information, see [OBProxy parameters](../15.appendix-2/10.obproxy-startup-parameters.md).
