# Create a connection

This topic describes how to create a new connection between the new and old OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) clusters. This way, you can directly select the created connection credentials if you need to connect to an OceanBase or OBProxy cluster or add a host for a task managed in the new OCP cluster.

## Procedure

1. In the upper-right corner of the OCP console, click the username and choose **Password Box**.
   The **Password Box** page appears.
   For security reasons, passwords are displayed as *******.

2. Click **Create Connection** in the upper-right corner and select a connection object.
   Available options: **OceanBase Cluster** and **Host**.

3. In the **Create Connection** dialog box, specify the information of the object to be connected.

   | **Object type** | **Required information** |
   | --- | --- |
   | OceanBase cluster | Specify the OceanBase cluster and OceanBase tenant to be connected, as well as the connection user, and the user password.  |
   | Host | Specify the connection credentials of the host to be connected. Including **Credential Name**, **User Type**, **Username**, **Password/Private Key**, **Applied Host**, and **Description** fields.  |

   > **Note**
   >
   > The connections to the SYS tenant can be used for the operations on the tenant and the cluster to which it belongs. The connections to other tenants can be used only for operations on themselves.

4. Click **OK**.
   The password box tests the connection credential. If the test fails, the connection creation fails.
