# Add a host

This topic describes how to add a host to OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) to add your offline resources to the OCP console.

## Prerequisites

* You are logged on with an account that has host management permissions.
* To use a custom installation directory and ports of OCP-Agent, modify the following parameters on the [System Parameters Management](../10.system-management-features/12.system-parameter-management-1.md) page.
  * The system parameter for the installation directory of OCP-Agent: `ocp.agent.home.path.prefix`.
  * The system parameters for the ports of OCP-Agent: `ocp.agent.manager.http.port` and `ocp.agent.monitor.http.port`.

   Before you add a host, you must wait about 3 minutes after the parameters are modified for modifications to take effect.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Hosts**.

3. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Add Host**.

4. Enter the IP address and SSH port number. Enter the IPv4 address of the new host. The SSH port number is 22 by default.

5. Select the host type. If the list does not include the corresponding host type, click Create Host Type to create a host type on OCP.

   A host type is a label assigned by the user for hosts of the same configurations. We recommend that you use a meaningful name for easier management of your hosts.

6. Select the IDC. If the list does not include the corresponding IDC, you can click Create IDC to create an IDC on OCP.

   * The region means the geographical region where the host is located. One physical region can have one or more physical IDCs.

   * The region and IDC are referenced in OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing policies. Specify the actual region and IDC.

   | Field | Description |
   |------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Credential Name | The name must start with a letter and end with a letter or a digit. It can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_). It must be 2 to 32 characters in length. |
   | Authorization Type | Two authorization types are supported: username/password and SSH private key.  |
   | User Type | SSH users with ROOT permissions are supported. A regular user with ROOT permissions must first be granted the permission to run sudo commands without a password. OCP allows you to grant the permission to run all sudo commands without a password by adding `username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` to the sudoers file in the /etc/ directory.  |

8. Optional. Enter the host description.

9. Click **OK**.
