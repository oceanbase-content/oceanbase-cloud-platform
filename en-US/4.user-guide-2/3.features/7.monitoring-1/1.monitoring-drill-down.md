# Drill-down monitoring

The drill-down monitoring feature guides you to view the same metric in different dimensions.

## Introduction

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides a wide range of monitoring metrics for OceanBase clusters, tenants, and hosts. Some of the metrics are associated among OceanBase clusters, tenants, and hosts.

When the queries per second (QPS) is abnormal, you can drill down the QPS metric to the tenant or OBServer dimension, and then view the value of QPS in that dimension, without bothering to switch to the **Performance Monitoring** page of the tenant or the **Monitoring** tab of the host.
For example, if the QPS of a cluster surges, you can locate the tenant and then the host where the QPS surges through drill-down.

You can drill down all submetrics of QPS to the tenant dimension, and then switch between tenants to quickly locate the tenant that causes the QPS spike of the cluster, as shown in the figure below.

## Instructions

The **performance monitoring data** of a cluster and a tenant can be drilled down to the following dimensions in the OCP console: **cluster** \> **tenant** \> **OBServer** .

* You can drill down the performance monitoring data of a cluster to the following dimensions: **cluster** \> **tenant** \> **OBServer** . For more information, see [Cluster performance monitoring](../../4.cluster-features/5.performance-monitoring-1.md).

* You can drill down the performance monitoring data of a tenant to the following dimensions: **tenant** \> **OBServer** . For more information, see [Tenant performance monitoring](../../5.tenant-functions/7.performance-monitoring.md).
