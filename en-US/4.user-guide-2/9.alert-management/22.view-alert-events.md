# View an alert event

This topic describes how to view details about an alert event and temporarily block an alert event.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Alerts**.

3. Wait until the **Alert Events** tab appears.

4. Specify search criteria in the search area. All alert events that match the search criteria will be displayed in the **Alert Events** list.

   * You can search for alert events by **Alert Status**, **Alert Level**, **Start Time**, **End Time**, **Keyword**, **Application**, and **Alert Scope**. Exact match is supported.

   * You can click **Export Alert Event** to export all alert events that match the search criteria to your computer.

   * If alert pushes are configured for the alert event, you can click **Failed** in the **Message Push** column to view details about the alert event.

   * If no alert push is configured for the alert event, you can click **Message Push Not Configured** in the **Message Push** column to configure alert pushes for the alert event. For more information, see [Create an alert push](20.create-alarm-push.md).

   2. In the **Alert Event History** section, view the alert event history and related information, including **Alert Time**, **Alert Level**, and **Alert Status**.

   3. In the resource usage section, filter resource usage trends by **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, **Last 7 Days**, or **Custom Time**. The resource usage data of three hours before and after the alarm time is displayed by default.

   4. View the alert notification history in the **Alert Messages** list.

6. On the details page of the alert event, click **Alert Masking** in the upper-right corner to block alert messages. For more information, see [Block an alert event](23.shielded-alert.md).

   Then the alert will not be reported before the block period expires.

7. When many alert events are received, you can clear alert messages as needed.

   1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Parameter Management**.
   2. Search for the `ocp.alarm.notification.expired-days` parameter in the parameter list to set the retention period of alert messages, in days.

   After you specify this parameter, the alert messages and alert events that exceed the retention period will be deleted. The following data will be deleted upon expiration:

      * `ocp2_alarm_notification`
      * `ocp_alarm_event_notification`
      * `ocp2_alarm_event_history`
      * `ocp_alarm_event_record`
      * `ocp2_alarm_filter` (Cleared data will be written to `ocp2_alarm_filter_history`. The amount of rule information is small and therefore the rule history table does not need to be cleared.)

    <main id="explain" type='notice'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>We recommend that you do not specify a short alert message clearing period. You can set the period to several months. Alerts must not be left uncleared and unhandled for a long time. You can configure alert message push. We recommend that you promptly handle received alert messages. </p>
