# Create an alert rule

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides built-in alert rules to meet the monitoring requirements of your business. You can also customize alert rules by referring to this topic. Compared with [creating an alert template](9.create-alarm-template.md), creating an alert rule allows you to more flexibly specify alert objects for each rule.

For more information about the built-in alert rules, see [Alert Reference](../../9.alarm-reference/1.alert-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console is granted the ADMIN or ALARM_MANAGER role.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Alerts**.

3. On the **Alert Rules** tab, click **Create Alert Rule**.

4. Specify the fields in the **Basic Information** section of the alert rule.

   1. Specify **Alert Rule Name**.

      Third-party applications identify and connect to alert rules in OCP through their names specified by **Alert Rule Name**. An alert rule name can contain only letters, digits, and underscores (_). We recommend the following rules for naming alerts:

      * Use `ob_cluster_` as the prefix for alerts related to OceanBase clusters.

      * Use `ob_tenant_` as the prefix for alerts related to OceanBase Database tenants.

      * Use `ob_host_` as the prefix for alerts related to OBServers.

      * Use `host_` as the prefix for alerts related to OCP servers.

      * Use `ob_service_` as the prefix for alerts related to OCP services.

      * Use `obproxy_cluster_` as the prefix for alerts related to OBProxy clusters.

      * Use `obproxy_host_` as the prefix for alerts related to OBProxy servers.

   2. Specify **Description**.

      Briefly describe the purpose of the alert rule.

   3. Specify **Rule Group**.

      Add the alert rule to an existing rule group.

   4. Specify whether to **Enable Alerting**.

      You can disable system built-in alert rules and custom alert rules that are temporarily not used.

5. Specify the fields in the **Rule Configuration** section for the alert rule.

   1. Specify **Alert Object**.

      | Alert Object | Description |
      |--------|---------|
      | Application | The alert source. Options include **OceanBase**, **OBProxy**, **OCP**, **OMS**, and **Logs**. |
      | Alert Object Type | The object type of the alert rule. You can select an object type as needed. The options vary with the setting of **Application**.  |
      | Alert Object | The alert objects that use the alert rule. You can select specific alert objects as needed. If you select **All**, existing objects and objects added in the future that are of the current alert object type will be included. You can select **Excluded Objects** on the right to exclude objects that do not need to use the alert rule.  |

   2. Specify **Alert Rule**.

      You can configure different operation rules based on your business requirements. The system reports alerts of different levels based on the configured operation rules.

      Configuration of operation rules:

      * Single metric

         A single operation rule is configured for alert reporting. You can configure at most five rules because the threshold and level in a rule cannot overlap with those in another rule.

         | Field | Description |
         |--------|---------|
         | Metric | Select a metric from the **Metric** drop-down list. For more information about metrics, see the corresponding topics in [Alert Reference](../../9.alarm-reference/1.alert-overview.md). </br>You can click **Add Metric** in the **Metric** drop-down list to add a custom alert metric.  |
         | Duration | Specify the alert duration. The value **0** indicates that an alert is immediately triggered if the specified operation rule is met. |
         | Alert Level | Specify the alert level.  |

      * Multiple metrics

         Multiple metrics are suitable for complex alert scenarios. You can configure multi-level **AND** or **OR** metric relationships for an alert rule.

         | Field | Description |
         |--------|---------|
         | Metric relationship | Select an operation mode for multiple metrics. Options include **AND** and **OR**. **AND** indicates that all conditions must be met. **OR** indicates that any one of the conditions is met.  |
         | Metric | Select a metric from the **Metric** drop-down list. For more information about metrics, see the corresponding topics in [Alert Reference](../../9.alarm-reference/1.alert-overview.md). </br>You can click **Add Metric** in the **Metric** drop-down list to add a custom alert metric.  |
         | Add Rule | Add one or more rules for the metric. The system performs an operation on the rules based on the selected metric relationship.  |
         | Add Rule Group | Add a rule group and configure a metric relationship for multiple metrics in the rule group. A rule group is a collection of operations for multiple metrics.  |
         | Duration | Specify the alert duration. The value **0** indicates that an alert is immediately triggered if the specified operation rule is met. |
         | Alert Level | Specify the alert level.  |

         In the following figure, multiple metrics are configured. A critical alert is triggered when the resource metrics of a server meet one of the following conditions for 2 minutes:

         * The memory usage exceeds 95%.
         * The Network Time Protocol (NTP) clock offset exceeds 100 ms.
         * The CPU utilization exceeds 95%, and the average value of `load1_per_cpu` exceeds 2%.

   3. Specify **Alert Cycle**.

      **Alert Cycle** specifies the detection cycle at which the system detects whether the trigger condition is met. In the following example, the default detection cycle of 60 seconds is used:
      * The system detects whether the trigger condition is met once every 60 seconds. If yes, the alert is reported.

      * After the alert is reported, the system continues to detect whether the trigger condition is met once every **alert cycle**. If yes, the alert will not be eliminated.

   4. Specify **Time Before Clearance**.

      This parameter specifies the retention duration of an alert after the alert is reported. The system automatically clears the alert after the specified duration expires. The default cycle is 5 minutes.

6. Specify alert details.

   You can reference variables by using `${}`. The alert details template is displayed in the alert event and corresponds to the `${alarm_description}` variable. This variable can be referenced in the alert message template.

7. Click **Submit**.
