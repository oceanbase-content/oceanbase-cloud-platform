Manage ASH report
======================================

This topic describes how to generate and view the active sessions history (ASH) report. The ASH report provides you with the SQL statements that use the most database resources during a diagnosis period, the execution details of historical sessions of an OceanBase cluster, and other information. You can optimize the SQL statements based on the information and improve the SQL execution efficiency.
