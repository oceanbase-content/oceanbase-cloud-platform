Performance report
=======================================

This topic describes how to use a performance report. A performance report provides you with information about the cluster load, performance, and SQL statements within a specified period of time, and helps you learn the cluster running status and troubleshoot performance-related problems.

Introduction
---------------------------------

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) can generate cluster performance reports. The Reports list on the Performance Reports page contains the following columns: **Report Name** , **Snapshot Start Point** , **Snapshot End Point** , **Created By** , **Status** , **Generated At** , and Actions. The Actions column provides the **View Report** and **Download Report** options.

* You can sort the reports by **Snapshot Start Point** , **Snapshot End Point** , and **Generated At** .

* You can filter the reports by **Generation Status** .

Generate a performance report
--------------------------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** .

2. Find the target cluster in the **Clusters** list and click the cluster name. The **Overview** page appears.

3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Report** to go to the performance report details page.

4. Click **Generate Performance Report** in the upper-right corner on the page that appears.

5. In the dialog box that appears, set the following parameters.

   |----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Report Name          | Required. The name of the report.                                                                                                                    |
   | Snapshot Start Point | You can select only a point in time in the past 30 days. The available points in time are fixed and cannot be customized.                            |
   | Snapshot End Point   | You can select only a point in time within 24 hours after the Snapshot Start Point. The available points in time are fixed and cannot be customized. |

6. If the SQL monitoring data of a tenant is abnormal in the performance report, select the tenant from the **View OceanBase Tenant ASH Report** drop-down list to go to the **ASH Report** page of the tenant.

7. Click **OK** . A report is generated for the performance between the snapshot start point and the snapshot end point. You can view the report in the Reports list and download it.

View and download a report
-----------------------------------------------

OCP shows a list of performance reports generated in the last 90 days.

* To view a performance report, click **View Report** in the **Actions** column.

* To download a performance report in the .html format, click **Download Report** in the **Actions** column.

You can view the following information in a performance report:
