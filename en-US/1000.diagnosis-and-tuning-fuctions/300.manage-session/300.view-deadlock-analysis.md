# View deadlock analysis information

This topic describes how to view deadlock analysis information.

You can view deadlock analysis information from the following entries:

* **Entry 1**:

   Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and go to the **Overview** page of the target tenant. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Session Management** and go to the **Deadlock Analysis** tab.

* **Entry 2:**

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Real-time Diagnostics** page. Click **Session Management** and go to the **Deadlock Analysis** tab.

## Prerequisites

* You have the permissions to manage tenants.

* Automatic detection of deadlocks has been enabled for the cluster where the tenant is located. For more information, see [Enable automatic detection of deadlocks](../../600.cluster-functions/300.manage-a-cluster/900.enable-automatic-deadlock-detection.md).

## Procedure

The following procedure takes Entry 2 as an example.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OceanBase Autonomy Service**.

3. In the **Cluster Details** section, click the name of the target cluster.

4. Go to the **Session Management** tab on the **Real-time Diagnostics** page.

5. Click the **Deadlock Analysis** tab and view the deadlock details.

   OceanBase Database automatically detects and clears deadlocks when automatic detection of deadlocks is enabled. You can check the number of deadlock nodes, interrupted deadlock nodes, and SQL statements executed by each node, and can determine whether to commit or roll back the transaction based on the SQL exception information.
