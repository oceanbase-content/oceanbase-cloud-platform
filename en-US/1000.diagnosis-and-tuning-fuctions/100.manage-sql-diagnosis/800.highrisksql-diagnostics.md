# High Risk SQL diagnostics

OCP support view the SQL statements that are identified as risky for system performance, security, and data according to rules.

The following table describes the types of high-risk SQL statements that can be identified in OCP.

| Operation | Example | Risk type                                                 | Description |
|------  |-----------------------------------------------------------|   ----     |    ----     |
| Add or delete a column | <ul><li> `alter table test drop column id` </li><li>`alter table test add new_id int not null comment 'New ID'` </li> </ul> | Schema change - Columns are added or deleted.             | - |
| Delete a table or database | <ul><li>`drop table test`  </li><li>`drop database test` </li> </ul> | A table or database is deleted.                           | - |
| Empty a table | `truncate table test` | A data table is cleared.                                  | - |
| Update without conditions | `update test set new_id =1` | An update without conditions is performed.                | - |
| Update with a permanently true condition | `update test set new_id =1 where 1 = 1` | An update with a permanently true condition is performed. | - |
| Delete without conditions | `delete from test` | Deletion without conditions is performed.                 | - |
| Delete with a permanently true condition | `delete from test where 1=1` | Deletion with a permanently true condition is performed.  | - |
| Too many rows returned | `max_return_rows > 50000` | Too many rows are returned.                               | The `max_return_rows` parameter specifies the maximum number of returned rows allowed for an SQL statement. If the number of returned rows exceeds this value, the SQL statement is considered at high risk. You can modify the parameter as needed. For more information, see [Manage system parameters](../../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-system-parameter/100.view-system-parameters.md).  |
| Too many rows affected | `max_affected_rows > 50000` | Too many rows are affected.                               | The `max_affected_rows` parameter specifies the maximum number of affected rows allowed for an SQL statement. If the number of affected rows exceeds this value, the SQL statement is considered at high risk. You can modify the parameter as needed. For more information, see [Manage system parameters](../../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-system-parameter/100.view-system-parameters.md).  |
| Too many partitions involved | `max_partition_cnt >2000` | Too many partitions are involved.                         | The `max_partition_cnt` parameter specifies the maximum number of involved partitions allowed in an SQL statement. If the number of partitions exceeds this value, the SQL statement is considered at high risk. You can modify the parameter as needed. For more information, see [Manage system parameters](../../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-system-parameter/100.view-system-parameters.md).  |

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Autonomous service**.

3. In the **Cluster Details** section, click the name of the target cluster.

4. By default, the **SQL Diagnostics** tab of the **Real-time Diagnostics** page appears.

5. Click the **High Risk SQL** tab.

6. Specify the filter conditions, filter the High Risk SQL statements.

     * Time Range: You can select Last 5 Minutes, Last 10 Minutes, Last 20 Minutes, Last 30 Minutes, Last 1 Hour, or Last 3 Hours from the **Time Range** drop-down list. You can also select Custom Time from the drop-down list and specify the start time and end time as needed. By default, the information of the last 30 minutes is displayed.

     * Internal SQL: If you select this option, the SQL statements internally initiated in OceanBase Database are displayed in the query result.

     * Keyword: The SQL statements that contain the specified keyword are displayed in the query result.

     * Advanced Search: You can add multiple filter conditions in **Advanced Search** . Click **Add** . In the **Add Advanced Condition** dialog box, you can specify a metric, an operator, and a metric value. The SQL statements that match the specified criteria will be displayed in the query result.

7. Click **Search** to list all SQL statements that meet the search criteria. You can perform the following operations on the query results:
  
   * Click **Export TopSQL** to export all the SQL statements in the query result.

   * View High Risk SQL information.

       1. Click **Custom Column** . In the dialog box that appears, specify the expression and name for the custom column. Then, you can view the column in the TopSQL list.

       2. You can click the SQL text of an SQL statement to go to the SQL Details page of the statement.

          On the **SQL Details** page, you can view the following details of the SQL statement:

          * In the **SQL Text** section, you can view the complete SQL statement.

          * On the **Previous Tendency** tab, you can view the historical trends of the SQL statement. For more information, see [View the historical trends of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

          * On the **Execution Plans** tab, you can view the execution plans of the SQL statement, or bind an execution plan to the statement. For more information, see [View the execution plans of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

          * On the **Index** tab, you can view the indexes bound to the SQL statement. For more information, see [View and bind indexes](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

          * On the **SQL Throttling** tab, you can view or set throttling of the SQL statement. For more information, see [Set SQL throttling](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).
