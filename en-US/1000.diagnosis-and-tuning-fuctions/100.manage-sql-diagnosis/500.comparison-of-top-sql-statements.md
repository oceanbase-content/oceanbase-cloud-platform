# View Comparison of Top SQL Statements

This topic describes how to view comparison of Top SQL statements.

## Procedure

You can view comparison of Top SQL statements by using one of the following methods.

* Method 1:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Autonomous Services** to go to the **Real-time Diagnostics** page.

   3. The **SQL Diagnostics** page automatically appears.

* Method 2:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. To go to the O&M page of the tenant.

   3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **SQL Diagnostics** to go to the **SQL Diagnostics** page.

The following takes **Method 1** as an example.

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Autonomous service**.

3. In the **Cluster Details** section, click the name of the target cluster.

4. By default, the **SQL Diagnostics** tab of the **Real-time Diagnostics** page appears.

5. In the list on the **TopSQL** tab, click **Comparison of Top SQL Statements** and choose **Comparison by Period** or **Comparison on Different Nodes** in the panel that appears to compare and analyze the top SQL statements in different dimensions.

    * **View the comparison details of top SQL statements in different time periods**

        On the **Comparison by Period** tab, the system displays the SQL statements that meet the following rules within the specified **Period for Comparison** in comparison against the specified **Baseline Period**:

        * The SQL statement is ranked top N for the first time. The value of N is specified by the `perf.sql.top-sql-comparison.new-in-top-n-limit` parameter in OCP. The default value of the parameter is `100`.
        * An increase in the number of executions of the SQL statement exceeds the specified threshold. The threshold is specified by the `perf.sql.top-sql-comparison.executions-increase-limit` parameter in OCP. The default value of the parameter is `20%`.
        * An increase in the average response time for the SQL statement exceeds the specified threshold. The threshold is specified by the `perf.sql.top-sql-comparison.elapsed-time-increase-limit` parameter in OCP. The default value of the parameter is `20%`.
        * An increase in the average number of returned rows for the SQL statement exceeds the specified threshold. The threshold is specified by the `perf.sql.top-sql-comparison.return-rows-increase-limit` parameter in OCP. The default value of the parameter is `20%`.
        * An increase in the error rate of the SQL statement exceeds the specified threshold. The threshold is specified by the `perf.sql.top-sql-comparison.error-percentage-increase-limit` parameter in OCP. The default value of the parameter is `10%`.
        * An increase in the percentage of remote plans for the SQL statement exceeds the specified threshold. The threshold is specified by the `perf.sql.top-sql-comparison.remote-plan-percentage-increase-limit` parameter in OCP. The default value of the parameter is `20%`.
        * An increase in the number of executions of the SQL statement exceeds the specified threshold. The threshold is specified by the `perf.sql.top-sql-comparison.executions-increase-limit` parameter in OCP. The default value of the parameter is `10%`.

        Procedure:

        1. Specify **Baseline Period** and **Period for Comparison**.

            * Select a period of time for **Baseline Period**.
            * Set **Comparison Period** to **Previous Period**, **Same Period of Previous Day**, **Same Period Last Week**, or a custom period.

        2. Click **Comparative Analysis** and view the details on the **Comparison of Details** and **Comparison of Performance Trends** tabs.

            * **Comparison of Details**: On this tab, you can view details about SQL statements.

                You can click the SQL text of an SQL statement to view its details and click the trend chart icon on the right to view the metric trend comparison chart.

            * **Comparison of Performance Trends**: On this tab, you can view the performance trend comparison charts of SQL statements, including the read/write response time, number of read/write requests, and CPU utilization.

    * **View the comparison details of top SQL statements on different nodes**

        You can compare the execution performance of the same SQL statement on different nodes.

        1. Select the baseline node and the node for comparison.

        2. Select an analysis period.

            You can view the comparison details of the last five minutes, last half hour, last hour, last six hours, or a custom time range.

        3. Click **Comparative Analysis** to view the data comparison details and response time trend details.

            * **Comparison of Details**: On this tab, you can view details about SQL statements.

                You can click the SQL text of an SQL statement to view its details and click **Column Management** in the upper-right corner to configure the column expression and column name of a custom column in the dialog box that appears.

            * **Response Time Trend Comparison**: This tab shows the execution duration ratio trends of the baseline node and the node for comparison.

                Click **All SQL Types** in the upper-right corner to select the type of SQL statements that you want to view.
