Diagnose parallel SQL statements
===================================

A parallel SQL statement is an SQL statement executed by using parallel scheduling in a tenant. You can use the parallel SQL diagnostics feature to identify SQL statements that do not meet query performance expectations in analytical processing.

## Prerequisites

You have enabled parameters in the **SQL Diagnostics Collection** section by referring to [Manage parameters](../../600.cluster-functions/300.manage-a-cluster/1200.manage-om-configuration/200.manage-om-configuration-parameters.md).

Procedure
-------------------------

You can diagnose parallel SQL statements by using one of the following methods:

* Method 1: Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OceanBase Autonomy Service**. On the page that appears, find the target cluster and click its name to go to the **Real-time Diagnostics** page.

* Method 2: Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. On the **Overview** page of a tenant, click **SQL Diagnostics** in the left-side navigation pane.

   <h4>Applicability</h4>
   <p>OCP Community Edition does not support the OceanBase Autonomy Service. To use this service, go to the session management page by using <b>Method 2</b>. </p>
</main>

The procedure of **Method 1** is described as follows:

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OceanBase Autonomy Service**. On the **Cluster Details** page, click the name of the target cluster to go to its **Real-time Diagnostics** page.

2. By default, the **SQL Diagnostics** tab appears.

    The SQL diagnostic data is not displayed on the **SQL Diagnostics** tab if you do not set the values of both the cluster parameter `enable_sql_audit` and the tenant parameter `ob_enable_sql_audit` to `True`. You can click **Change Cluster Parameters** in the prompt to modify the parameter values.

3. Click the **ParallelSQL** tab.

4. Filter parallel SQL statements.

   1. Specify the filter conditions.

     * **Time Range**: You can select **Last 5 Minutes**, **Last 10 Minutes**, **Last 20 Minutes**, **Last 30 Minutes**, **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 3 Hours**, or **Last 6 Hours** from the **Time Range** drop-down list. You can also select **Custom Time** from the drop-down list and specify the start time and end time as needed. By default, the information of the last 6 hours is displayed.

     * **OBServer**: You can select an OBServer node or all OBServer nodes in the list. If you select an OBServer node, only SQL statements executed on the selected OBServer node are queried.

     * **Internal SQL**: If you select this option, the SQL statements internally initiated in OceanBase Database are displayed in the query result.

     * **Keyword**: The SQL statements that contain the specified keyword are displayed in the query result. The keywords filter SQL statements in the same way as the SQL LIKE operator. The entered strings are automatically prefixed and suffixed with a percent sign (%).

     * **Advanced Search**: You can add multiple filter conditions in **Advanced Search**. Click **Add**. In the **Add Advanced Conditions** dialog box, you can specify a metric, an operator, and a metric value. The SQL statements that match the specified conditions will be displayed in the query result.

   2. Click **Search** to list all SQL statements that meet the search criteria.

5. Click **Export ParallelSQL** to export all SQL statements in the query result.

6. View information about parallel SQL statements.

   1. Click **Column Management**. In the dialog box that appears, select the columns to display. Then, you can view the selected columns in the parallel SQL statement list.

   2. On the **ParallelSQL** tab, you can view the columns selected. You can copy the SQL text and filter the SQL statements by database. You can also sort the SQL statements by the degree of parallelism, number of executions, total response time, and average response time. You can also view the diagnostic result.

   3. You can click the SQL text of an SQL statement to go to the **SQL Details** page of the statement, where you can view the following details of the SQL statement:

     * In the **SQL Text** section, you can view the complete SQL statement.

     * In the **SQL Execution Profile** section, you can view the execution details of the SQL statement at the operator level in the data collection time range. For more information, see the **View the execution profile of an SQL statement** section in [View details of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * On the **Previous Tendency** tab, you can view the historical trends and plan generation time of the SQL statement. For more information, see the **View the historical trends of an SQL statement** section in [View details of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * On the **Execution Plans** tab, you can view the execution plans of the SQL statement, or bind an execution plan to the statement. For more information, see the **View the execution plans of an SQL statement** section in [View details of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * On the **Index** tab, you can view the indexes bound to the SQL statement. For more information, see the **View and bind indexes** section in [View details of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * On the **SQL Throttling** tab, you can view or set throttling of the SQL statement. For more information, see the **Set throttling for an SQL statement** section in [View details of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * You can view the binding records of the SQL statement in section â‘  as illustrated on the **Execution Plans**, **Index**, and **SQL Throttling** tabs.

       In the binding records, you can view the status of a bound execution plan, or click **Unbind** to unbind the plan from the SQL statement. You can click **Bind Plan** to bind the plan to the SQL statement again.

7. Set throttling.

   * You can click **Enable Throttling** to enable throttling for the SQL statement. For more information, see the **Set throttling for an SQL statement** section in [View details of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

   * Select multiple SQL statements and click **Batch Set Throttling**. In the dialog box that appears, specify the maximum number of SQL statements that can be executed concurrently.
