# ParallelSQL diagnostics

A ParallelSQL statement is an SQL statement configured with a degree of parallelism in a single execution. You can use ParallelSQL diagnostics to identify SQL statements that fall short of expectation in performance in analytical processing.

## Procedure

You can diagnostics Parallel SQL by using one of the following methods.

* Method 1:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Autonomous Services** to go to the **Real-time Diagnostics** page.

   3. The **SQL Diagnostics** page automatically appears.

* Method 2:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. To go to the O&M page of the tenant.

   3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **SQL Diagnostics** to go to the **SQL Diagnostics** page.

The following takes **Method 1** as an example.

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Autonomous service**.

3. In the **Cluster Details** section, click the name of the target cluster.

4. By default, the **SQL Diagnostics** tab of the **Real-time Diagnostics** page appears.

   The SQL diagnostic data is not displayed on the **SQL Diagnostics** page if you do not set the values of both the cluster parameter enable_sql_audit and the tenant parameter ob_enable_sql_audit to True. You can click Change Cluster Parameters in the prompt to modify the parameter values.

5. Click the **Parallel** **SQL** tab.

6. Filter ParallelSQL statements.

   1. Specify the filter conditions.

     * Time Range: You can select Last 5 Minutes, Last 10 Minutes, Last 20 Minutes, Last 30 Minutes, Last 1 Hour, or Last 3 Hours from the **Time Range** drop-down list. You can also select Custom Time from the drop-down list and specify the start time and end time as needed. By default, the information of the last 30 minutes is displayed.

     * OBServer: You can select an OBServer or All OBServers in the list. If you select an OBServer, only SQL statements executed on the selected OBServer are queried.

     * Internal SQL: If you select this option, the SQL statements internally initiated in OceanBase Database are displayed in the query result.

     * Keyword: The SQL statements that contain the specified keyword are displayed in the query result. The keywords filter SQL statements in the same way as the SQL Like operator. The entered strings are automatically prefixed and suffixed with a percent sign (%).

     * Advanced Search: You can add multiple filter conditions in **Advanced Search** . Click **Add** . In the **Add Advanced Conditions** dialog box, you can specify a metric, an operator, and a metric value. The SQL statements that match the specified search criteria are displayed in the query result.

   2. Click **Search** to list all SQL statements that meet the search criteria.

7. Click **Export ParallelSQL** to export all the SQL statements in the query result.

8. View ParallelSQL information.

   1. Click **Column Management** . In the dialog box that appears, select the columns to display. Then, you can view the selected columns in the ParallelSQL list.

   2. On the **ParallelSQL** tab, you can view the columns selected. You can copy the SQL text and filter the SQL statements by database. You can also sort the SQL statements by the degree of parallelism, number of executions, total response time, and average response time. You can also view the diagnosis result.

   3. You can click the SQL text of an SQL statement to go to the **SQL Details** page of the statement, where you can view the following details of the SQL statement:

     * In the **SQL Text** section, you can view the complete SQL statement.

     * In the **SQL Execution Profile** section, you can view the execution details of the SQL statement at the operator level in the data collection time range. For more information, see [View the execution profile of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * On the **Previous Tendency** tab, you can view the historical trends and plan generation time of the SQL statement. For more information, see [View the historical trends of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * On the **Execution Plans** tab, you can view the execution plans of the SQL statement, or bind an execution plan to the statement. For more information, see [View the execution plans of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * On the **Index** tab, you can view the indexes bound to the SQL statement. For more information, see [View and bind indexes](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * On the **SQL Throttling** tab, you can view or set throttling of the SQL statement. For more information, see [Set SQL throttling](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

     * You can view the binding records of the SQL statement in section â‘  as illustrated on the **Execution Plans** , **Index** , and **SQL Throttling** tabs.

       In the binding records, you can view the status of a bound execution plan, or click **Unbind** to unbind the plan from the SQL statement. You can click **Bind Plan** to bind the plan to the SQL statement again.

9. Set throttling.

   * You can click **Enable Throttling** to enable throttling for the SQL statement. For more information, see [Set SQL throttling](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

   * Select multiple SQL statements and click **Batch Set Throttling** . In the dialog box that appears, specify the maximum number of SQL statements that can be executed concurrently.
