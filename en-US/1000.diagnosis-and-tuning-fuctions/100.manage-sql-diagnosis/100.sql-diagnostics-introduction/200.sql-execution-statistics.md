# SQL statement execution statistics

The SQL diagnostics feature provides a wide range of metric statistics. You can create custom columns to filter SQL statement execution statistics.

Metrics in the **Column Management** dialog box are classified into four types: time model metrics, common metrics, basic information metrics, and execution plan metrics.

## Time model metrics

After an OBServer node receives an SQL request from a user, it creates timestamps to record the time consumed when the SQL statement is executed in each stage within OceanBase Database. The following figure shows the runtime time model for a local SQL statement:

As shown in the preceding figure, the time model includes the following time segments:

* Network transmission time: the interval between the time when the client sends the SQL statement and the time when the OBServer node receives the SQL statement, which is the time consumed on the network.
* Network wait time: the interval between the time when the OBServer node receives the SQL statement and the time when the SQL statement enters the processing queue of the OBServer node, which is the time consumed at the network architecture layer of the OBServer node.
* Queuing time: the interval between the time when the SQL statement enters the processing queue and the time when the SQL statement is dequeued. When processing resources of the OBServer node are insufficient, the SQL statement waits in the queue until sufficient processing resources are available.
* Parsing time: the interval between the time when the SQL statement is dequeued and the time when the physical plan is executed, which is the time spent by the SQL engine of OceanBase Database in generating or obtaining a plan.
* Execution time: the interval between the execution start time and end time of the plan. The execution time consists of CPU time and wait time. The wait time is classified into the application wait time, concurrency wait time, I/O wait time, and scheduling wait time.

The following table describes the metrics in the SQL execution time model provided by OCP.
