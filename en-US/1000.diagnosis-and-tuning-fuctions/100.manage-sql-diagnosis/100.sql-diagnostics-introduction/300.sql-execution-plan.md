# SQL execution plans

An execution plan describes the process of executing an SQL query statement in OceanBase Database. You can execute the EXPLAIN statement to view the logical execution plan generated by the optimizer for a given SQL statement.
To analyze the performance of an SQL statement, you need to first check the SQL execution plan to see if any error exists. Therefore, understanding the execution plan is the first step for SQL tuning, and knowledge about operators of an execution plan is key to understanding the EXPLAIN statement.
