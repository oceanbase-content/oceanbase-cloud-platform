# SQL diagnostics overview

SQL issues are the most common type of performance issues. OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides multi-dimensional SQL diagnostics and classifies SQL statements into top SQL statements, slow SQL statements based on their running characteristics. If an error occurs during the execution of an SQL statement, you can select a diagnostic type based on the scenario to analyze the error.  You can also view and modify execution plans in SQL plans and outlines.

## TopSQL diagnostics

The TopSQL diagnostics feature collects SQL statement execution statistics by SQL ID, displays historical execution trends of SQL statements, and allows you to sort SQL statements by different resource consumption metrics. TopSQL allows you to analyze these SQL statements to identify abnormal requests or optimize specific SQL statements.

## SlowSQL diagnostics

In OCP, an SQL statement whose execution time exceeds the specified threshold, which is 100 ms by default, is considered a slow SQL statement. You can modify the threshold based on your business scenarios. A slow SQL statement has the following impacts:

* Long response time
* Large system resource consumption, even system unavailability in extreme cases

Therefore, to ensure system stability, you must collect and analyze SlowSQL statistics to identify issues and avoid risks in an early stage. The SlowSQL diagnostics feature focuses on the information about a single SQL execution. OCP samples data from `v$sql_audit` in OceanBase Database to allow you to analyze the resource consumption and execution details of slow SQL statements from various dimensions.
