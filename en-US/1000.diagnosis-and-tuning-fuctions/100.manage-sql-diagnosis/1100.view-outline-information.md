View outlines
==================================

On the **Outlines** page, you can view the outlines of an OceanBase Database tenant, including the outlines for throttling, execution plan binding, and index binding.

Prerequisites
----------------------------------

* For a tenant in MySQL mode, the password box of the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) user must contain the password of the tenant.

* For a tenant in Oracle mode, the password box of the OCP user must contain the password of the SYS tenant in the cluster.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>To bind indexes and execution plans and configure throttling, the logged-on tenant in the OCP console must have the permission to update the tenant .</p>
  </main>

Features
-----------------------------

The outline feature relies on the hint and plan cache features of OceanBase Database. The hint feature determines the selection of the physical plan generation path by specifying the index and the connection method. The plan cache caches physical plans for SQL statements. When the same SQL statement is executed again in the same environment, the system reads its execution plan from the plan cache. It does not have to go through the parser, resolver, rewriter, and optimizer modules again. This speeds up the execution of SQL statements. The outline feature uses hints to specify how to fix plans by modifying the physical execution plan in the plan cache.
