# Suspicious SQL diagnostics

Suspicious SQL statements are statements that meet specific criteria based on the statement, execution history, and table structure and may cause performance issues. You can handle suspicious SQL statements based on the suggestions given.

## Procedure

You can diagnostics suspicious SQL by using one of the following methods.

* Method 1:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Autonomous Services** to go to the **Real-time Diagnostics** page.

   3. The **SQL Diagnostics** page automatically appears.

* Method 2:

   1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

   2. To go to the O&M page of the tenant.

   3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **SQL Diagnostics** to go to the **SQL Diagnostics** page.

The following takes **Method 1** as an example.

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Autonomous service**.

3. In the **Cluster Details** section, click the name of the target cluster.

4. By default, the **SQL Diagnostics** tab of the **Real-time Diagnostics** page appears.

   The SQL diagnostic data is not displayed on the **SQL Diagnostics** page if you do not set the values of both the cluster parameter enable_sql_audit and the tenant parameter ob_enable_sql_audit to True. You can click Change Cluster Parameters in the prompt to modify the parameter values.

5. Click the **Suspected SQL** tab.

6. Filter the suspicious SQL statements.

   1. Specify the filter conditions.

     * Time Range: You can select Last 5 Minutes, Last 10 Minutes, Last 20 Minutes, Last 30 Minutes, Last 1 Hour, or Last 3 Hours from the **Time Range** drop-down list. You can also select Custom Time from the drop-down list and specify the start time and end time as needed. By default, the information of the last 30 minutes is displayed.

     * Internal SQL: If you select this option, the SQL statements internally initiated in OceanBase Database are displayed in the query result.

     * Keyword: The SQL statements that contain the specified keyword are displayed in the query result. The keywords filter SQL statements in the same way as the SQL Like operator. The entered strings are automatically prefixed and suffixed with a percent sign (%).

     * Advanced Search: You can add multiple filter conditions in **Advanced Search** . Click **Add** . In the **Add Advanced Condition** dialog box, you can specify a metric, an operator, and a metric value. The SQL statements that match the specified criteria will be displayed in the query result.

   2. Click **Search** to list all SQL statements that meet the search criteria.

     You can copy the SQL text and view the diagnosis result. You can also filter the SQL statements by database, and then sort the suspicious SQL statements by the number of executions, average response time, average CPU time, and plan generation time.

7. Click **Export Suspicious SQL Statements** to export all suspicious SQL statements in the query result.

8. View the information of suspicious SQL statements.

   You can click the SQL text of an SQL statement to go to the SQL Details page of the statement. On the **SQL Details** page, you can view the following details of the SQL statement:
   * In the **SQL Text** section, you can view the complete SQL statement.

   * In the **Optimization Suggestions** section, you can view the optimization suggestions for the SQL statement. For more information, see [View optimization suggestions](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

   * View diagnosis result: You can view the diagnosis result for a specified time range.

    The following table describes some diagnoses and their suggested solutions.

CPU time occupancy = CPU time for executing the SQL statement/CPU time for executing all SQL statements of the tenant \* 100%.  Check your business scenarios, data distribution changes, request surges, and execution plan changes.        |

    By default, SQL diagnostics is triggered in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) only when some attributes such as the SQL response time and execution frequency exceed the specified thresholds. You can modify default values of specific parameters on the **System Parameters** page of OCP, to specify the objects and criteria for diagnostics. For information about the parameter, see [OCP configuration parameters](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1400.sql-performance-diagnosis-related-parameter-configuration.md).

   * On the **Previous Tendency** tab, you can view the historical trends of the SQL statement. For more information, see [View the historical trends of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

   * On the **Execution Plans** tab, you can view the execution plans of the SQL statement, or bind an execution plan to the statement. For more information, see [View the execution plans of an SQL statement](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

   * On the **Index** tab, you can view the indexes bound to the SQL statement. For more information, see [View and bind indexes](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

   * On the **SQL Throttling** tab, you can view or set throttling of the SQL statement. For more information, see [Set SQL throttling](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

   * You can view the binding records of the SQL statement in section ① as illustrated on the **Execution Plans** , **Index** , and **SQL Throttling** tabs.

    In the binding records, you can view the status of a bound execution plan, or click **Unbind** to unbind the plan from the SQL statement. You can click **Bind Plan** to bind the plan to the SQL statement again.

9. Set throttling.

   * You can click **Enable Throttling** to enable throttling for the SQL statement. For more information, see [Set SQL throttling](../100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1000.view-sql-details.md).

   * Select multiple SQL statements and click **Batch Set Throttling** . In the dialog box that appears, specify the maximum number of SQL statements that can be executed concurrently.
