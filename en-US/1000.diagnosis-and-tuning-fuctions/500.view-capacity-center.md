2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OceanBase Autonomy Service**.

3. In the **Cluster Details** section, click the name of the cluster that you want to view.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Capacity Center** to view the related information as follows:

   1. View the cluster capacity risks. The current capacity check items include the tenant CPU utilization, memory usage, disk usage, and number of connections.

   4. View the tenant capacity.

      1. You can filter the statistics by tenant, database, and table group.

      2. You can view the trends of disk usage, number of partition replicas, CPU utilization, and memory usage in the selected time range.

         You can select Last **7 Days**, **Last 30 Days**, **Last 6 Months**, or **Last 1 Year** or specify a custom period as the time range to view the status of a specified tenant, database, or table group. Note that the trend charts of CPU utilization and memory usage are available only at the tenant level.

      3. You can sort databases and table groups by **Data Amount** or **Disk Usage**.
