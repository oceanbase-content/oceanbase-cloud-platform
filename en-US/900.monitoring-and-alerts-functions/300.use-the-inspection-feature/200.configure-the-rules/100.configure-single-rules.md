# Configure a scheduling rule for a single object

This topic describes how to configure a custom scheduling rule for an inspection object. If you want to configure a unified scheduling rule for objects managed in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), see [Configure a global scheduling rule](../200.configure-the-rules/200.configure-global-rules.md).

## Background information

After you configure a scheduling rule for an object, OCP periodically inspects the object based on the scheduling rule. For more information, see [Inspection](../100.inspection-management.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alert > Inspection**.

2. Wait until the **Inspection List** page appears.

3. Click the tab containing the target inspection object.

4. Select the object that you want to inspect from the list, move the pointer over the More icon (**...**) in the Actions column, and select **Configure Scheduling Rule**.

5. On the **Configure Scheduling Rule** page, configure the scheduling cycle and scheduling duration for different inspection scenarios, and set the scheduling deadline and whether to enable the scheduling rule.

6. Click **Submit**.
