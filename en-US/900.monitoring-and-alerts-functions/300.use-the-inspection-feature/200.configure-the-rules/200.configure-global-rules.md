# Configure a global scheduling rule

This topic describes how to configure a unified scheduling rule for objects managed in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). If you want to configure custom scheduling rules based on object characteristics, see [Configure a scheduling rule for a single object](../200.configure-the-rules/100.configure-single-rules.md).

## Background information

After you configure a global scheduling rule, OCP periodically inspects the OceanBase clusters, OceanBase tenants, and OBProxy clusters managed in OCP based on the scheduling rule. For more information, see [Inspection](../100.inspection-management.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alert > Inspection**.

2. Wait until the **Inspection List** page appears.

3. Click **Configure Global Scheduling Rule** in the upper-right corner. The **Configure Global Scheduling Rule** page appears.

4. Select objects to which the scheduling rule applies.

   You can select **Objects Without Scheduling Rules** or **All Objects (Including Objects with and without Scheduling Rules)**.
   * **Objects Without Scheduling Rules**: If you select this option, the scheduling rule will apply only to objects without custom scheduling rules, and objects with scheduling rules will still be inspected based on the existing rules.
   * **All Objects (Including Objects with and without Scheduling Rules)**: If you select this option, the scheduling rule will apply to all objects. If you select **All objects**, the scheduling rule will overwrite the existing custom scheduling rules of the objects.

5. In the **Scheduling Rule** section, configure the scheduling cycle and scheduling duration for different inspection scenarios, and set the scheduling deadline and whether to enable the scheduling rule.

6. Click **Submit**.
