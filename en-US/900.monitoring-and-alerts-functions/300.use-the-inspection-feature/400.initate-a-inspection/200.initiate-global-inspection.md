## Background information

After you initiate an inspection, OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) immediately starts to inspect the OceanBase clusters, OceanBase tenants, and OBProxy clusters managed in OCP based on the inspection items. For more information, see [Inspection](../100.inspection-management.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alert > Inspection**.

2. Wait until the **Inspection List** page appears.

3. Move the pointer over **Initiate Global Inspection** in the upper-right corner and select an inspection scenario from the drop-down list.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.
