# Inspection

This topic describes the inspection feature of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), including how to configure inspection items, configure scheduling rules, initiate inspections, and view inspection history.

## Features

Inspection is an essential method to identify problems in a system and ensure its stable and effective operation. The inspection feature of OCP checks performance of the OceanBase system and its environment, generates reports to expose security risks that cannot be detected by the monitoring or alerting feature, and allows you to download the reports.

You can configure inspection rules to enable regular or ad hoc inspections of the partition information, serial number, and parameters of the cluster, and troubleshoot the cluster based on the inspection results to ensure the normal operation of OCP clusters.

If this is your first time to use the inspection feature, take the following steps:

1. [Configure inspection items](150.configure-inspection-items.md). Select inspection items as needed.

2. Configure a scheduling rule. You can [Configure a scheduling rule for a single object](200.configure-the-rules/100.configure-single-rules.md) or [Configure a global scheduling rule](200.configure-the-rules/200.configure-global-rules.md).

3. Perform other operations on the inspection objects. You can [initiate an inspection for a single object](400.initate-a-inspection/100.initate-single-inspection.md) or [initiate a global inspection](400.initate-a-inspection/200.initiate-global-inspection.md).

4. You can [View an inspection task](../300.use-the-inspection-feature/500.view-an-inspection-task.md), [view an inspection report](600.manage-inspection-report/100.view-inspection-report.md), and [download an inspection report](600.manage-inspection-report/200.download-inspection-report.md).

## Configure inspection items

Inspection items define the basis for identifying risks of resources managed in OCP. The inspection feature checks resources based on rules configured in the inspection items and returns the corresponding risk levels.

On the **Configure Inspection Items** page, you can view the name, type, inspection scenario, description, and inspection rule of each inspection item, and enable or disable the inspection items.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Inspection Item | The name of the inspection item configured in the system, which is globally unique.  |
| Inspection Item Type | The type of the inspection item, for example, OceanBase cluster, OceanBase Database tenant, or OBServer.  |
| Inspection Object Type | The type of the objects to which the inspection item applies. The inspection items vary with inspection objects. Inspection objects include OceanBase clusters, OceanBase Database tenants, and OBProxy clusters.  |
| Inspection Scenario | The scenario to which the inspection item applies, including basic inspection, performance inspection, and in-depth inspection.  |
| Description | The description of the inspection item.  |
| Inspection Rule | The rule configured in the inspection item.  |

For more information, see [Configure inspection items](150.configure-inspection-items.md).

## Configure a scheduling rule

A scheduling rule defines a template for performing an inspection task. The inspection task runs based on the scheduling rule.

You can specify the scheduling cycle, scheduling duration, scheduling end time, and whether to enable the scheduling rule.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Scheduling Cycle | The scheduling cycle, which is on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis.  |
| Scheduling Time | The time for starting inspection.  |
| Scheduling End Time | The time for stopping scheduling. After the time expires, automatic inspection will not be performed.  |
| Enable Scheduling Rule | Specify whether to enable the scheduling rule. The scheduling rule is disabled by default. If the scheduling rule is disabled, automatic inspection will not be performed.  |

For more information, see [Configure a scheduling rule for a single object](200.configure-the-rules/100.configure-single-rules.md) and [Configure a global scheduling rule](200.configure-the-rules/200.configure-global-rules.md).

## Initiate an inspection

After you initiate an inspection, OCP immediately starts inspection based on the inspection items. Inspection items in OCP apply to the following scenarios:

* Basic inspection: checks the basic status of resources managed in OCP, including the status of clusters and replicas. This scenario is suitable for routine inspection.
* Performance inspection: checks the performance of resources managed in OCP, such as large transactions and slow queries. This scenario is suitable for performance analysis.
* In-depth inspection: performs in-depth inspection on resources managed in OCP to detect hidden risks. This scenario is suitable for pre-peak inspection.

You can initiate an inspection for a single object in a scenario or initiate a global inspection for all objects in a scenario. For more information, see [Initiate an inspection for a single object](400.initate-a-inspection/100.initate-single-inspection.md) and [Initiate a global inspection](400.initate-a-inspection/200.initiate-global-inspection.md).

## Inspection history

The **Inspection History** tab displays all initiated inspection tasks. It summarizes the levels and number of security risks of inspection objects.

On the **Inspection History** tab, you can view the inspection task ID, inspection object, inspection object type, inspection scenario, inspection start time, inspection end time, task status, and inspection results. You can also perform common operations, for example, [View an inspection task](../300.use-the-inspection-feature/500.view-an-inspection-task.md), [View an inspection report](600.manage-inspection-report/100.view-inspection-report.md), and [Download an inspection report](600.manage-inspection-report/200.download-inspection-report.md).
