# OCP Overview

This topic describes the overview page of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), which shows information about various resources that are managed in OCP, such as OceanBase clusters, OceanBase Database tenants, OBProxy clusters, and hosts. You can view the alerts, diagnostics, and usage of those resources for quick troubleshooting.
