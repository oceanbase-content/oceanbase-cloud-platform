# Send alert messages through email

You can send alert messages through email and view alert messages by using an email client.

## Prerequisites

* You have obtained the port of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service. The default port is 25 or 465, depending on the environment. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is disabled when port 25 is used, and is enabled when port 465 is used.

* You have obtained the username and password of the email address from which the alert messages will be sent, which are required by some systems.

## Considerations

* OCP of a version earlier than V4.2.0 does not support sending alert messages to multiple email addresses.
* In OCP of a version earlier than V4.2.0, if port 465 is used with TLS enabled, alert messages will fail to be sent. In this case, you must use port 25 without enabling TLS, or upgrade OCP to a version later than V4.2.0.

## Procedure

1. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alert** > **Alert**.

2. On the alert details page, click the **Alert Channel** tab.

3. On the **Alert Channel** tab, click **Create Channel**.

4. Configure the email alert channel.

   1. Basic settings

      | Parameter | Required? | Description |
      |-------|----------|------|
      | Channel Type | Yes | Select Email from the drop-down list.  |
      | Channel Name | Yes | The name of the channel for identification.  |
      | Recipient Email Address | Yes | The email address used to receive alert messages.  |

   2. Channel settings

      | Parameter | Required? | Description |
      |-------|----------|------|
      | SMTP Server | Yes | The address of the STMP server, for example, `stmp.163.com`.  |
      | Port | Yes | The STMP service port. TLS is disabled when port 25 is used, and is enabled when port 465 is used. The default port is 25 or 465, depending on the environment.  |
      | Enable TLS | Yes | Specifies whether to enable the TLS protocol.  |
      | Username | Yes | The username of the email address used to send alert messages. Other accounts can also be used.  |
      | Password | Yes | The password of the email address used to send alert messages.  |
      | Sender Email Address | Yes | The email address used to send alert messages. You can change it as needed.  |

   3. Message settings

      1. The default message format is text in OceanBase Cloud of a version earlier than V4.2.1, and it is in Markdown format since OceanBase Cloud V4.2.1.

      2. You can modify the message structure. Here is a sample of the message structure of the default format:

         Set **Alert Message Format** to `Markdown`. You can enter `${}` to introduce a variable.

         ```shell
         ### OCP alert notification ${alarm_name}
         - Level: ${alarm_level}
         - Alert object: ${alarm_target}
         - Summary: ${alarm_summary}
         - Generation time: ${alarm_active_at}
         - Description: ${alarm_description}
         - OCP link: ${alarm_url}
         ```

5. You can use other features.

   Alert message aggregate: You can enable the channel aggregate feature to avoid repeatedly sending the same alert within a period. Since OCP V4.1.0, an alert is generated every 3 minutes by default. After you enable channel aggregate, an alert is sent only once every 10 minutes (600 seconds).

6. Click **Submit**.
