# Scale in an OBProxy cluster

This topic describes how to scale in an OBProxy cluster.

## Scenarios

Remove some OBProxies from an OBProxy cluster.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that your business will not be affected after the OBProxies are removed.

## Procedure

Perform the following steps in sequence:

**Step 1: Switch the traffic**

1. Change the weight of the OBProxies to be removed to 0. This way, the traffic of new connections is not forwarded to the OBProxies.

2. Monitor the number of connections and business traffic on the OBProxies. It may take hours or days before the existing connections are released.

3. If the persistent connections created for business cannot be released, you can terminate those connections during off-peak hours. An error is expected. Proceed with caution.

4. Confirm that no business connections exist on the OBProxies to be removed.

**Step 2: Remove OBProxies**

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**. On the page that appears, click the name of the target OBProxy cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

3. In the OBProxy list, find a target OBProxy and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column. You can also select multiple OBProxies and click **Batch Delete**.
