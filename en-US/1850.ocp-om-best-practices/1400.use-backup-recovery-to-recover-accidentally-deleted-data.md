# Use the backup and restore module to restore data

As a core component to ensure the high availability of OceanBase Database, the backup and restore module protects data security by preventing misoperations and damages to the storage media and allowing you to restore the lost data.

## Scenarios

* Scenario 1: The source OceanBase cluster managed by OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) is running.
* Scenario 2: The source OceanBase cluster is deleted or failed.
* Scenario 3: The destination OceanBase cluster is not managed by OCP.

## Prerequisites

* You have backed up the source OceanBase cluster or enabled regular backup of the source OceanBase cluster.
* The destination OceanBase cluster has access to the backups of the source OceanBase cluster.
* The destination OceanBase cluster has sufficient resources to restore the backup tenant.

## Considerations

You must check the version of the cluster to which you want to restore data. You can restore the backup data of an OceanBase cluster only to an OceanBase cluster of the same or a later version.

For example, if you have backed up the data of an OceanBase cluster of V4.2.0, you can restore the backup data to only an OceanBase cluster of V4.2.0 or a later version. In addition, you cannot restore the backup data of an OceanBase cluster of a version earlier than V4.0 to an OceanBase cluster of V4.0 or a later version.

## Procedure

* **Scenario 1**: Initiate a restore task on the O&M page of a cluster or tenant or the **Recovery** page of the OCP console. For more information, see [Initiate a restore task](../1100.backup-and-restoration-functions/700.initiate-a-recovery-task.md).

* **Scenario 2**: Initiate a restore task on the **Recovery** page of the OCP console. For more information, see [Initiate a restore task](../1100.backup-and-restoration-functions/700.initiate-a-recovery-task.md).

* **Scenario 3**: Initiate a restore task by using the CLI tool. For information about how to restore an OceanBase cluster of V4.0 or an earlier version, see [Perform full restore](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000000946221). For information about how to restore an OceanBase cluster of a version later than V4.0, see [Perform physical restore](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000218383).

## FAQ

**What can I do if the source tenant of the source cluster parsed by OCP is empty or the restorable period parsed for the source tenant is empty?**

Please contact OCP Technical Support for assistance.

**How do I view the progress of a restore task?**

* If you restore an OceanBase cluster whose version is V2.2.77 or later, but earlier than V4.0, you can view the restore progress on the GUI of the OCP console.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You can view the progress of a restore task only on OCP V4.0.1 and later. </p>

* If you restore an OceanBase cluster of V4.0 or a later version, you can view the restore progress by using a CLI tool. For more information, see [Query the restore progress](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000218387).

**How do I cancel a restore task?**

For information about how to cancel the restore of an OceanBase cluster of a version earlier than V4.0, see [Cancel restore](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000000946225). For information about how to cancel the restore of an OceanBase cluster of V4.0 or a later version, see [Cancel restore](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000033517).
