# Integrate OCP monitoring into Prometheus

This section describes how to integrate the monitoring feature of OceanBase Database into Prometheus.

## Scenarios

You need to use your Prometheus system for integrated business monitoring.

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed Prometheus V2.28 or later.
* You have deployed OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) V4.2.2 or later.
* You have the read permission on the host. We recommend that you create a dedicated user for Prometheus integration and grant the HOST_VIEWER role to the user. The HOST_VIEWER role has read-only permission on the OCP host .

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **System Parameters**. Check the values of the following system parameters.

   | Parameter | Description | Expected value |
   |---------|------|-------|
   | ocp.monitor.prometheus.service.discovery.enabled | Specifies whether to enable Prometheus HTTP service discovery. | true |
   | ocp.monitor.server.exporter.auth.enabled | Specifies whether to enable authentication for OCP self-monitoring. | false |
   | ocp.agent.auth.metric-auth-enabled | Specifies whether to enable authentication for the monitoring API of OCP-Agent. | false |

3. Configure the data collection parameters in the Prometheus configuration file. Here is an example:

   ```xml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: ocp_sd
       http_sd_configs:
         - url: 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port/api/v2/monitor/prometheus_sd'
           basic_auth:
             username: a****
             password: '******'
   ```

   | Parameter | Description |
   |------|------|
   | url | The IP address, port, and API of the OCP service.  |
   | username | The name of the account. We recommend that you create a dedicated user for Prometheus integration and grant the HOST_VIEWER role to the user. The HOST_VIEWER role has read-only permission on the OCP host .  |
   | password | The password for the account.  |

   After you specify the parameters, Prometheus can call APIs to obtain the exporter addresses and collect monitoring data.

4. Log on to the service address of Prometheus and choose **Status** > **Targets**. Then, verify that the exporter address is correct.
