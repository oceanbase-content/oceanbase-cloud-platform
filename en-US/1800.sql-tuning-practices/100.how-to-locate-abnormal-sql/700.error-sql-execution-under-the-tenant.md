# How can I locate erroneous SQL statements in a tenant?

Business or business tables can be modified during maintenance, which may cause invalidation of business SQL statements. In addition, SQL statements may fail when the business volume or data volume increases. In this case, the running status of SQL statements must be monitored in a timely manner to avoid business losses.

On the **TopSQL** tab, click **Column Management** and select error statistics options such as **Error Count**, **Proportion of Errors**, **Timeout Errors**, **Insufficient Memory Errors**, **Syntax Errors**, **Conflicting Key Errors**, **Data Overlength Errors**, **Unknown Column Errors**, and **Transaction Roll-back Errors**. Then sort the SQL statements on the tab by the **Error Count** column.
