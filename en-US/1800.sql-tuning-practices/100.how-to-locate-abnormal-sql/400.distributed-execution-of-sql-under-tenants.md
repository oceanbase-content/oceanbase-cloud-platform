# How can I locate distributed SQL statements in a tenant?

OceanBase Database is a distributed database that allows you to distribute data read and write services to all servers in a cluster. Distributed execution is less efficient than local execution. Therefore, OceanBase Database provides the table group syntax to bind business tables to a [table group](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000001702699). This converts distributed execution into local execution and improves query efficiency.

On the **TopSQL** tab, click **Column Management** and select **Proportion of Distributed Plans (%)**. Then sort the SQL statements on the tab by the **Proportion of Distributed Plans (%)** column.
