# How can I locate slow hard-parsed SQL statements in a tenant?

If an SQL statement does not hit the plan cache during [execution](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000001692964), it must be hard-parsed to generate a new plan and new constraints. Slow hard parsing increases the response time of the SQL statement and affects business efficiency.

On the **TopSQL** tab, click **Column Management** and select **Parsing Time**. Then sort the SQL statements on the tab by the **Parsing Time** column.
