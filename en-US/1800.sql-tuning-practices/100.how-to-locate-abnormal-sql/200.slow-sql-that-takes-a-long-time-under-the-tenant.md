# How can I locate slow SQL statements that take a long time in a tenant?

Slow SQL statements cause poor user experience and consume a large amount of database resources, resulting in database instability. Therefore, the number of slow SQL statements must be reduced in various dimensions.
For example, to locate SQL statements that take more than 100 ms, you can click **Column Management** on the **TopSQL** or **SlowSQL** tab, and select **Maximum Response Time**. Then enter **Maximum Response Time >= 100ms** in **Conditions** and click **Search**.
