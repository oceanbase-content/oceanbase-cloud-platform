# How can I locate SQL statements for full-table scans in a tenant?

Full table scans consume a large amount of resources. You must check whether your business contains semantics that require full-table scans. We recommend that you add filter conditions or partitioning keys to the query statement. In addition, if your business table is a partitioned table, you can add a global index to avoid full-table scans.

On the **TopSQL** tab, you can click **Column Management** and select **Table Scan**. Then sort the SQL statements on the tab by the **Table Scan** column.
