# How can I locate remote SQL statements in a tenant?

Each business table in OceanBase Database has one leader and multiple followers. Only the leader can provide strong-consistency read and write services. The followers can provide weak-consistency read services.

Strong-consistency read and write requests sent to the OceanBase cluster must be routed to the server where the leader resides. If a strong-consistency read or write request is routed to the server where a follower resides, the request must be forwarded to the leader within the OceanBase cluster so that the leader can provide services. The execution result is returned to the server where the follower resides, and then this server returns the result to the client. In this remote execution mode, the request is additionally forwarded twice, which increases the response time of the SQL statement. Therefore, this type of SQL statements must be analyzed.

On the **TopSQL** tab, click **Column Management** and select **Proportion of Remote Plans (%)**. Then sort the SQL statements on the tab by the **Proportion of Remote Plans (%)** column.
