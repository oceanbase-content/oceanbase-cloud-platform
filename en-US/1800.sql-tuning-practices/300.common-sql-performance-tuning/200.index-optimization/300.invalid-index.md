# Invalid index of an SQL statement

## Scenario

An SQL statement has multiple indexes, but the index selected by the plan does not achieve optimal performance. Possible causes:

* The index specified in the SQL hint leads to poor performance or does not exist.
* An inappropriate index is bound to the SQL outline.
* The data distribution of input parameters used during hard parsing of the SQL statement is applicable to a minority of scenarios. As a result, an incorrect execution path is selected.
* The plan generated based on the data distribution during SQL tuning is not suitable for the data distribution after the business runs for a period of time.

## Case analysis

The index bound to the SQL statement does not exist, as shown in the following diagnostic information:

The following figure shows the index information, which indicates that the `ineffective_hint` hint contains only the primary key but not an index named `indexA`.

## Optimization suggestions

Cancel the index specified in the SQL hint so that the optimizer automatically selects an index.
