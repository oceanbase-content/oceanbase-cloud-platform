# Conditions

The **Conditions** field of SQL diagnostics supports six operators for filtering metrics provided in **Column Management**. You can search for abnormal SQL statements by specifying multiple conditions in the **Conditions** field.

For example, if you want to locate SQL statements that involve multi-partition scans and whose average response time exceeds 100 ms, you can specify the following conditions in the **Conditions** field:

* **Average Response Time >= 100**
* **Proportion of Distributed Plans > 0**

You can further add conditions based on the preceding conditions. For example, if you want to search for SQL statements that involve multi-partition scans and whose average response time exceeds 100 ms and parsing time (corresponding to **Plan Generation Time** in **Column Management**) exceeds 10 ms, you can add the conditions shown in the following figure.

You can select multiple metrics in **Column Management** to search for SQL statements based on your requirements in different scenarios.
