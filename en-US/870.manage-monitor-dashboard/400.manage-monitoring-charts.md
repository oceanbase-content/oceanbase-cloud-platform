OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to add a chart by using the following methods:

* Method 1: Click the ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/422/%E5%A4%A7%E7%9B%98%E6%96%B0%E5%A2%9E%E5%9B%BE%E8%A1%A8.png) icon on the tab of a dashboard and select **Add Chart** from the drop-down list.
* Method 2: On the tab of a dashboard without charts, click **Add Chart** to add one.

The procedure of **Method 1** is described as follows:

1. Log in to the OCP console.

4. In the panel that appears, specify relevant information and click **OK**.

    The following table describes the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |---------------|---------|
   | Display Form | The display mode of charts. Valid values: **Single Chart** and **Multiple Charts**. <ul><li>**Single Chart**: In this mode, you can add a single chart for the following scenarios: a single metric of a single object, multiple metrics of a single object, a single metric of multiple objects, and multiple metrics of multiple objects. </li><li>**Multiple Charts**: In this mode, you can batch add multiple single-object single-metric charts. If you select multiple monitoring objects or metrics, the system automatically generates chart names in the "object: metric" format and the description, and displays multiple single-object single-metric charts. </br>For example, in multi-chart mode, if you select the `cluster01` and `cluster02` clusters as the monitoring objects, and `sql_all_count` and `sql_select_count` as the monitoring metrics, the system generates the following four single-object single-metric charts: `cluster01: sql_all_count`, `cluster02: sql_select_count`, `cluster02: sql_select_count`, and `cluster02: sql_select_count`. </li></ul> |
   | Chart Name | The unique identifier of the monitoring chart in the dashboard. It must be 2 to 32 characters in length.  |
   | Show Group | Optional. The group to which the monitoring chart belongs. Charts in the same group are displayed in the same module. <ul><li>You can click **Add Group** to add a group. </li><li>When you add a chart in a specific group, this parameter is unavailable. </li></ul> |
   | Chart Description | Optional. The description of the monitoring chart to be added.  |
   | Select monitoring objects and metrics | Perform the following steps:<ol><li>**Select Monitoring Object Type**: Select **OceanBase Cluster**, **OceanBase Database Tenant**, **OBProxy Cluster**, or **Host**. </li><li>**Select Monitoring Objects**: Select monitoring objects of the specified type from the drop-down list. </li><li>**Select Monitoring Metrics**: Select monitoring metrics for the specified monitoring objects from the drop-down list. <ul><li>If a required metric exists in the drop-down list, directly select it. Otherwise, you can click **Add Metric** at the bottom of the drop-down list to add one. For more information, see [Create a metric](../880.manage-performance-monitoring/200.manage-custom-monitoring/300.manage-indicator-items/100.create-a-indicator-item.md). </li><li>The monitoring metrics displayed in the drop-down list include built-in metrics of OCP and user-defined metrics. For more information about built-in metrics of OCP, see [Overview of metrics](../1900.reference-guide/300.monitoring-indicator-reference/100.overview-of-metrics.md). </li></ul><main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>At most two types of units are allowed for the selected metrics. </p></main></li><li>**Select Chart Type**: At present, the following types of charts are supported: <ul><li>Trend charts: line charts, area charts, and bar charts. </li><li>Display charts: statistical metric cards and tables. </li><li>Percentage charts: liquid fill charts and doughnut charts. </li></ul> </li></ol> |
