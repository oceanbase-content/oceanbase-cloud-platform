# Manage dashboards

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to predefine a dashboard to display monitoring metrics of concern on the same page. Each dashboard is a tab. You can classify monitoring charts by dashboard.

## Prerequisites

* You have the `PROFILE` privilege.
* Dashboards created by different users are mutually isolated. You can view and manage only your own monitoring dashboards.

## Create a dashboard

Before you add monitoring charts, perform the following steps to create a dashboard:

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Monitoring Dashboards**.

3. Click **Create Dashboard** or the ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/422/%E6%96%B0%E5%BB%BA%E5%A4%A7%E7%9B%98.png) icon in the upper-right corner.

4. In the dialog box that appears, enter the name of the dashboard and click **OK**.

   The dashboard name must be unique and 2 to 32 characters in length.

By default, automatic refresh is in the **Off** state.

* **Associate charts**: You can click **Associate Charts** (as indicated by ⑤ in the following figure) to enable chart association and hover the pointer over a point in time of a chart. Then, other charts on the same dashboard will display the data at the same point in time on the lateral axis. You can compare the monitoring data of different metrics.
