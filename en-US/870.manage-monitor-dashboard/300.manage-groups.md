# Manage groups

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to classify monitoring charts. You can classify associated metrics into the same group for unified management, thereby facilitating database monitoring and analysis.

## Prerequisites

* You have the `PROFILE` privilege.
* Dashboards created by different users are mutually isolated. You can view and manage only your own monitoring dashboards.

## Create a group

After you create a dashboard, you can create a group for monitoring charts to be added. The charts in the same group are displayed in the same module.

OCP allows you to create a group by using the following methods:

* Method 1: Click the ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/422/%E5%A4%A7%E7%9B%98%E6%96%B0%E5%A2%9E%E5%9B%BE%E8%A1%A8.png) icon on the tab of a dashboard and select **Add Group** from the drop-down list. By default, the newly created group is displayed at the top.
* Method 2: Select a group on the tab of a dashboard, click the ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/422/%E5%88%86%E7%BB%84%E6%96%B0%E5%A2%9E%E5%9B%BE%E8%A1%A8.png) icon, and select **Add Group** from the drop-down list to create a new group below the selected group.

The following procedure takes **Method 1** as an example.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Monitoring Dashboards**.

3. Go to the tab of the dashboard for which charts are to be added. Click the Add icon and select **Add Group** from the drop-down list.
4. Specify a name for the group.

   After the group is added, all groups in the dashboard are displayed in the left-side navigation pane. You can quickly switch between groups.
