# Monitoring dashboard overview

This topic describes the monitoring dashboard, including its features, usage process, and supported chart types.

## Features

The monitoring dashboard is intended for monitoring scenarios and meets the requirements for defining custom monitoring views.

On the monitoring dashboard page, you can create multiple monitoring dashboard tabs. On each monitoring dashboard tab, you can add multiple charts to display different metrics and data. For example, you can display the monitoring views of multiple instances and metrics, or display different monitoring metrics of one or more clusters. Each monitoring dashboard allows you to view the **period-on-period**, **day-on-day**, **week-on-week**, and **month-on-month** comparison data, helping you to easily perceive the data pattern. You can also choose a chart type, such as line chart, pie chart, or table, based on the data characteristics, to facilitate data understanding and analysis.

Moreover, the monitoring dashboard allows you to group associated metrics or objects for unified management, thereby facilitating database monitoring and analysis. You can drag charts, zoom in on charts, drill down the monitoring data of a single metric, and change the chart type to monitor the overall performance and running status of the database system.

## Usage process

You can perform the following steps to create a monitoring dashboard:

1. Create a dashboard to display required monitoring charts on the same page. For more information, see [Manage dashboards](200.manage-dashboard.md).
2. (Optional) Create groups to classify monitoring charts to be added. For more information, see [Manage groups](300.manage-groups.md).
3. Create monitoring charts. For more information, see [Manage charts](400.manage-monitoring-charts.md).

## Supported chart types

The monitoring dashboard of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) supports four types of charts: chart for a single metric of a single object, chart for multiple metrics of a single object, chart for a single metric of multiple objects, and chart for multiple metrics of multiple objects.

* **Chart for a single metric of a single object**: This type of chart shows the monitoring data of a single metric for a single monitoring object. If you are concerned about a special monitoring metric of a specific monitoring object, you can add such a chart.

   The following figure shows a monitoring chart for the `cpu_percent` metric of a host.

* **Chart for multiple metrics of a single object**: This type of chart shows the monitoring data of multiple metrics for a single monitoring object. If you are concerned about multiple associated metrics of a specific monitoring object, you can add such a chart.

   The following figure shows a monitoring chart for the `obproxy_thread_count` and `obproxy_fd_count` metrics of a specific OBProxy cluster.

* **Chart for a single metric of multiple objects**: This type of chart shows the monitoring data of a single metric for multiple monitoring objects. If you are concerned about the same monitoring metric of multiple monitoring objects, you can add such a chart.

   The following figure shows a monitoring chart for the `io_read_count` metric of two OceanBase clusters.

* **Chart for multiple metrics of multiple objects**: This type of chart shows the monitoring data of multiple metrics for multiple monitoring objects. If you want to observe and compare different monitoring metrics of multiple monitoring objects, you can add such a chart.

   The following figure shows a monitoring chart for the `sql_select_count` and `sql_insert_count` metrics of two OceanBase clusters.
