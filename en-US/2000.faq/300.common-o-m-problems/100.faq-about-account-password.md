Accounts and passwords
-------------------------

**Q1: What do I do if I forget the password of the admin user?**

A: You can use another account that has the OCP user management privileges to change the password of the admin user.

**Q2: What are the account and password for logging on to OCP?**

A: You need to consult technical support to obtain the default account and default password for logging on to OCP. We recommend that you change the password of the admin user after you log on OCP for the first time.
