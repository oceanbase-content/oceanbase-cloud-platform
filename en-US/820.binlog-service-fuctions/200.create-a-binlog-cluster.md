# Create a binlog cluster

A binlog cluster is an external service that comprises one or more binlog servers. When the binlog service is started for a tenant in a binlog cluster with multiple binlog servers, a binlog server is selected based on the load balancing logic. When any binlog server fails, a functioning binlog server in the cluster will take over its services.

You can create a binlog cluster based on your business needs.

## Prerequisites

You have the permissions of the ADMIN user.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Binlog Service**.

2. On the **Cluster List** page, click **Create Binlog Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

3. On the **Create Binlog Cluster** page, configure the basic information of the cluster.

     | Parameter | Description |
     |-----|-------|
     | **Binlog Cluster Name**          | Enter a name for the binlog cluster. The name must start with a letter and end with a letter or a digit. It can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_). It must be 2 to 32 characters in length. |
     | **Software Version**       | The software version of the binlog cluster. If the required software package is unavailable in the list, you can click **Upload Package** below the list to upload one.  |
     | **Access Address**          | The access address of the binlog cluster, which is used for request forwarding and load balancing during the communication between OBProxy and the binlog cluster.   |
     | **Access Port** | The access port of the binlog cluster, which is **2983** by default. You can change the access port.   |

4. Specify the information of MetaDB.

   You need to specify the information about a MySQL tenant for storing the metadata of the binlog service. We recommend that you do not use a business cluster as the MetaDB.

     | Parameter | Description |
     |-----|-------|
     | **Cluster Name**    | Select an existing OceanBase cluster as the MetaDB for the binlog service. |
     | **Tenant Name**        | Select a MySQL tenant from the cluster.   |
     | **Database Username**        | Select a user in the MySQL tenant.  |
     | **Database Name**          | The name of the MetaDB, which is `binlog_database` by default. You can change the name.   |

5. Deploy the binlog cluster.

   Each binlog cluster comprises multiple binlog servers. The following table describes the parameters to be specified for each binlog server.

   |   Parameter   | Description   |
   |-----|-------|
   | **IDC**     | Select the IDC to which the binlog server belongs. A binlog server can belong to only one IDC.  |
   | **Model**       | Optional. If you select a model, the host list is filtered based on the model.   |
   | **Host**  | You can select or add hosts.   |

6. You can add and configure startup parameters one by one in the **Parameter Settings** section.

7. You can specify a custom software installation path in the **Custom Settings** section. The default path is `/home/admin/binlogservice`. You can change the path.

8. Click **Submit**.

9. After a cluster creation task is submitted, you can view the task progress in **Task Center**.

## Cluster list

After the cluster is created, you can view the cluster information in the following columns on the **Cluster List** page: **Binlog Cluster Name**, **Status**, **Allocated CPU**, **Allocated Memory**, **Data Disk Used**, **Version No.**, **Created At**, and **Modified At**.

* You can click the name of the cluster to go to its **Overview** page. For more information, see [View information about a binlog cluster](300.manage-a-binlog-cluster/100.binlog-cluster-overview.md).
* You can filter the binlog clusters by status.
