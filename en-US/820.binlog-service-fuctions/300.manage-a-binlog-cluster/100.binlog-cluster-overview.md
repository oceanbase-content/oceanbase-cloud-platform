| Binlog File Generation Directory   | The storage path of binlog data. Default value: `software installation path/run`  |

## View the binlog instance list

In the **Binlog Instance List** section, you can view information about all instances in the binlog cluster in the following columns: **Binlog Instance Name**, **Business Tenant**, **Node IP**, **Conversion Delay**, **Convert RPS**, **Subscription Links**, and **Status**. You can also click the **Stop**, **Start**, or **Restart** option in the **Actions** column of a binlog instance to operate the binlog instance. For more information, see [Manage binlog instances](500.manage-binlog-instance/100.binlog-instance-overview.md).

You can also click the **Stop**, **Start**, or **Delete** option in the **Actions** column of a binlog server to operate the binlog server. For more information, see [Manage binlog servers](600.manage-binlog-server/100.add-a-binlog-server.md).

## Perform cluster management operations

You can perform other cluster management operations on the **Binlog Cluster Overview** page. For more information, see [Add a binlog node](600.manage-binlog-server/100.add-a-binlog-server.md), [Start and stop a binlog cluster](200.stop-and-start-a-binlog-cluster.md), [Restart a binlog cluster](300.restart-a-binlog-cluster.md), and [Delete a binlog cluster](400.delete-a-binlog-cluster.md).

You can perform routine O&M operations on a cluster by using the options provided in the left-side navigation pane. For more information, see [Manage binlog cluster parameters](../400.manage-binlog-cluster-parameters.md).
