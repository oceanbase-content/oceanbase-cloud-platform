# Add a binlog node

You can add binlog nodes to a binlog cluster to scale out the cluster.

In OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you can add a binlog node by using either of the following methods:

* **Method 1**: On the **Cluster List** page, click **New Node** in the **Actions** column of the target cluster.
* **Method 2**: On the **Binlog Cluster Overview** tab, click **New Node** in the upper-right corner.

## Prerequisites

You have the permissions of the ADMIN user.

## Procedure

The following procedure describes how to add a binlog node by using **Method 2**.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Binlog Service**. The **Cluster List** tab automatically appears.

3. On the **Cluster List** page, find the target binlog cluster and click its name.

4. On the **Binlog Cluster Overview** tab, click **New Node** in the upper-right corner.

5. In the **New Node** dialog box, specify the IDC, model, and host of the binlog node to be added. You can select multiple hosts.

    By default, only one binlog node is added. To add more binlog nodes, click **New Binlog Server**.

6. Click **OK** to submit the task to add a binlog node.

   You can view the task progress in **Task Center**. When the task enters the **ExecuteSuccessful** state and the status of the corresponding binlog node is displayed as **Normal Operation** in the **Binlog Server List** section on the **Binlog Cluster Overview** page, the binlog node is successfully added.
