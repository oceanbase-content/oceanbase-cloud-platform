# Restart a binlog instance

You can restart a binlog instance as needed. Restarting a binlog instance interrupts the subscription connections to the instance. Proceed with caution.

In OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you can restart a binlog instance by using either of the following methods:

* **Method 1**: Go to the **Binlog Cluster Overview** page, find the target binlog instance in the **Binlog Instance List** section, click **More** in the **Actions** column, and select **Restart Binlog Instance**.
* **Method 2**: Go to the **Binlog Instance Overview** page, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and select **Restart Binlog Instance**.
