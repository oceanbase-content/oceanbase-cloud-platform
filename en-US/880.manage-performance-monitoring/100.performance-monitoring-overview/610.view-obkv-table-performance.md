# View OBKV-Table monitoring data

This topic describes how to view the OBKV-Table monitoring data of a tenant. OBKV-Table is a multi-model NoSQL database service. Based on the underlying engine of OceanBase Database, it provides three data models: table, key-value, and wide column. It stores massive structured and semi-structured data with low costs, and are applicable to business scenarios such as metadata, orders, bills, profiles, social media, feed streams, logs, and risk control. OBKV-Table and SQL operations are performed at two computing layers of the same level and by accessing the same distributed storage of OceanBase Database. In an architecture that integrates such relationship with NoSQL, you can use OBKV-Table for simple and quick data manipulation language (DML) operations and perform parallel complex SQL queries on the same copy of data at the same time.

## Prerequisites

* You have the **read-only** permission on the target tenant.
* The target tenant belongs to an OceanBase cluster whose version is V3.2.4.4 or later.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring**.

5. In the **Data Filtering** section, configure the parameters for filtering monitoring data.

   The following table describes the filter parameters.

   |     Parameter  |  Description  |
   |---------------|---------|
   | Tenant | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select a tenant to view its monitoring information.  |
   | Zone | By default, the monitoring information of all zones is displayed. |
   | OBServer | By default, the monitoring information of all OBServer nodes is displayed. |
   | Select Time | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select the time range of the data that you want to query.  |
   | Auto Refresh  | By default, the auto-refresh mode is disabled. After it is enabled, performance monitoring data is refreshed every 5 seconds. |

6. Click the **OBKV_Table** tab and view related monitoring data.

   For more information about the monitoring metrics, see [Overview of metrics](../../1900.reference-guide/300.monitoring-indicator-reference/100.overview-of-metrics.md). If the statistical range covers multiple OBServer nodes, the aggregate metric values of the OBServer nodes are displayed.

   The following features allow you to view and analyze the performance monitoring data on a trend chart in a more efficient manner. You can learn about the features with the help of the figure below.

   * Filter data.

     1. View the trend details of a metric over a specific period of time: To use this feature, drag the pointer over a period of time to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. To resume to the normal view, double-click the trend chart, as indicated by ① in the preceding figure.

     2. Hide the data of a submetric: To use this feature, click the icon of this submetric. The submetric will then turn gray and its data will be hidden from the chart, as indicated by ② in the preceding figure.

     3. View the detailed data of a specific point in time: To use this feature, hover the pointer over a point in time on the trend chart, as indicated by ③ in the preceding figure.

   * Zoom in on a trend chart: To use this feature, click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner of the chart. The features indicated by ①, ②, and ③ in the preceding figure are also applicable to a zoomed-in chart.

   * View SQL request analysis: On the **Response Time** trend chart, click **SQL Request Analysis** in the upper-right corner to view the request analysis details. For more information, see [View request analysis](../../1000.diagnosis-and-tuning-fuctions/100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1300.view-request-analysis.md).

   * Drill down to view monitoring data in different dimensions: When an abnormal metric exists, such as a long response time of a tenant, perform a drill-down analysis to identify the faulty server. Click the **Drill-down Analysis** icon in the upper-right corner of the trend chart to view the drill-down analysis details. The **OBKV_Table** tab supports the following drill-down dimensions: **tenant > OBServer node**.

       The features indicated by ①, ②, and ③ in the preceding figure are also applicable to a trend chart on a drill-down page. You can also perform the following operations:

       ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/420/%E8%AF%8A%E6%96%AD%E4%B8%8B%E9%92%BB-1.png)

       * In the **Data Filtering** section indicated by ① in the figure, specify filter conditions. If you do not specify any filter conditions, the drill-down page automatically inherits filter conditions from the upper-level page.

       * If the metric has submetrics, you can view the submetrics or drill down to other dimensions, as indicated by ② in the figure.

       * The trend chart also provides an entry to the host performance monitoring feature. Hover the pointer over the **Go to Host Performance Monitoring** link, as indicated by ③ in the figure, and click the target host to go to its **Performance Monitoring** page and view the monitoring details.

       * You can also click the icon indicated by ④ in the upper-right corner of a trend chart, and select the hosts whose performance monitoring data needs to be displayed on the trend chart.
