# View database performance

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to view the performance monitoring data of a cluster in different dimensions from the following entries:

* **Entry 1**:

   Log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alerts** > **Monitoring**. The **OceanBase Cluster** tab automatically appears.

* **Entry 2:**

   Log on to the OCP console and go to the **Cluster Overview** page. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring**.

## Prerequisites

You have the read-only permission on the target cluster.

## Procedure

The following procedure takes Entry 1 as an example.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alerts > Monitoring**.

3. The **OceanBase Cluster** tab automatically appears.

4. In the **Data Filtering** section, configure the conditions for filtering monitoring data.

   The following table describes the filter conditions.

   | Filter condition | Description |
   |---------------|---------|
   | Cluster | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select a cluster to view its monitoring information.  |
   | Zone | By default, the monitoring information of all zones is displayed.  |
   | OBServer | By default, the monitoring information of all OBServer nodes is displayed.  |
   | Select Time | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode.  Select a time range for the data that you want to query.  |
   | Auto Refresh | By default, auto-refresh is disabled. After auto-refresh is enabled, data is refreshed every 5s.  |

5. The **Database Performance** tab automatically appears. You can view corresponding performance monitoring data on this tab.

   For more information about monitoring metrics, see [Monitoring metrics](../../1900.reference-guide/300.monitoring-indicator-reference/100.overview-of-metrics.md). To display other metrics, click **Select Metric** in the upper-right corner of the tab and select the desired metrics in the **Select Metric** panel. The system can display up to 10 metrics.

   The following features enable you to better view and analyze the performance monitoring data on a trend chart. You can learn about the features with the help of the figure below.

   ![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/0214633561/p440402.png)

   1. Hide the data of a submetric: To use this feature, click the icon of the submetric. The submetric will then turn gray and its data will be hidden from the chart.

   2. View detailed data of a specific point in time or a period of time: You can hover the pointer over a point in time on the trend chart to view the detailed data. You can also drag the pointer to select a period of time on the trend chart and have a zoomed-in view of data in this period of time. To resume the normal view, double-click the trend chart.

   3. Zoom in on the trend chart: To use this feature, click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner. The features indicated by ① and ② in the preceding figure are also applicable to a zoomed-in chart.

   4. Drill down to view monitoring data in different dimensions: When an abnormal metric exists, such as a long response time of a tenant, perform a drill-down analysis to identify the faulty server. Click the **Drill-down Analysis** icon in the upper-right corner of the trend chart. The following drill-down dimensions are supported: cluster > tenant > OBServer node.

      The features indicated by ① and ② in the preceding figure are also applicable to a trend chart on a drill-down page. You can also perform the following operations:

      ![1202](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9114633561/p440409.png)

      1. In the **Data Filtering** section of the drill-down page, specify filter conditions. If you do not specify any filter conditions, the drill-down page automatically inherits filter conditions from the upper-level page.

      2. If the metric has submetrics, you can view the submetrics or click the link indicated by ① or ② to drill down to other dimensions for further analysis.

      3. If the metric is involved in the performance of a tenant or host, you can directly go to the **Monitoring** page of the tenant or server from the trend chart.

         * To go to the **Performance Monitoring** page of the tenant, move the pointer over the **Go to Tenant Performance Monitoring** link in the upper-right corner of the trend chart, and then click the tenant name.

         * To go to the **Monitoring** page of a host, hover the pointer over the **Go to Host Performance Monitoring** link in the upper-right corner of the trend chart, and click the IP address of the host.

      4. You can also click the button indicated by ③ or ④ in the upper-right corner of the trend chart to select the tenants or hosts whose data needs to be displayed on the trend chart.

6. (Optional) Configure the monitoring data collection interval.

   By default, OCP collects monitoring data per second. This collection interval has high requirements for the OCP server performance and MonitorDB storage performance. If you do not require a high collection frequency, you can change the value of the `ocp.metric.collect.interval.second` parameter in the `config_properties` file to increase the monitoring data collection interval, thus reducing required resources and increasing the manageable scale.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The system supports only the following values for this parameter: 1, 5, 10, and 15. If the value you entered is not one of them, the system adjusts the value based on the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If the entered value is smaller than 1, it is adjusted to 1. </li>
    <li>If the entered value is in the range of [1,5), it is adjusted to 1. </li>
    <li>If the entered value is in the range of [5,10), it is adjusted to 5. </li>
    <li>If the entered value is in the range of [10,15), it is adjusted to 10. </li>
    <li>If the entered value is greater than 15, it is adjusted to 15. </li>
    </ul>
   </main>

After you change the value, the configuration immediately takes effect. OCP collects monitoring data at this new interval. By default, the monitoring data display interval is three times the monitoring data collection interval, except for the case when the collection interval is 1 second. For example, if the monitoring data is collected every 5 seconds, the queried monitoring data is displayed by an interval of 15 seconds.
