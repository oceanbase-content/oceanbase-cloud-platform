# View OBKV-HBase monitoring data

This topic describes how to view the OBKV-HBase monitoring data of a tenant. OBKV-HBase is a database built based on OceanBase Database and compatible with HBase APIs. It is dedicated to the storage of massive structured and semi-structured data and provides ultrahigh read/write performance for wide tables. OBKV-HBase applies to a variety of scenarios such as big data analysis, data warehousing, content management, and public opinion monitoring on social media. You can use the HBase rich client developed by OceanBase to access OBKV-HBase to experience its capabilities including high throughput, multi-versioning, and automatic expiration.

## Prerequisites

* You have the read-only privilege on the target tenant.
* The target tenant belongs to a cluster of OceanBase Database V3.2.4.4 or later.

## Procedure

1. Log in to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring**.

5. In the **Data Filtering** section, configure the parameters for filtering monitoring data.

   The following table describes the filter parameters.

   |     Parameter  |  Description  |
   |---------------|---------|
   | Tenant | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select a tenant to view its monitoring information.  |
   | Zone | By default, the monitoring information of all zones is displayed. |
   | OBServer | By default, the monitoring information of all OBServer nodes is displayed. |
   | Select Time | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select the time range of the data that you want to query.  |
   | Auto Refresh | By default, the auto-refresh mode is disabled. After it is enabled, performance monitoring data is refreshed every 5 seconds. |

6. Click the **OBKV_HBase** tab and view related monitoring data.

   * OCP allows you to view monitoring data in two dimensions: tenant and unit. By default, the system displays the monitoring data in the tenant dimension. The metrics vary in different dimensions.
   * By default, the system displays all metrics in the current dimension. If you want to ignore a metric, click **Select Metric** on the right of the area and deselect the metric in the panel that appears.
   * For more information about the monitoring metrics, see [Overview of metrics](../../1900.reference-guide/300.monitoring-indicator-reference/100.overview-of-metrics.md). If the statistical range covers multiple OBServer nodes, the aggregate metric values of the OBServer nodes are displayed.

   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>In the <b>Response time</b> monitoring chart, the <code>99-all</code> and <code>95-all</code> metrics apply only to OceanBase Database V4.2.1.7 and versions later than V4.2.1.7 and earlier than V4.2.2.0. </p>

   The following features allow you to view and analyze the performance monitoring data on a trend chart in a more efficient manner. You can learn about the features with the help of the figure below.

   * Filter data.

     1. View the trend details of a metric over a specific period of time: To use this feature, drag the pointer over a period of time to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. To resume to the normal view, double-click the trend chart, as indicated by ① in the preceding figure.

     2. Hide the data of a submetric: To use this feature, click the icon of this submetric. The submetric will then turn gray and its data will be hidden from the chart, as indicated by ② in the preceding figure.

     3. View the detailed data of a specific point in time: To use this feature, hover the pointer over a point in time on the trend chart, as indicated by ③ in the preceding figure.

   * Zoom in on a trend chart: To use this feature, click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner of the chart. The features indicated by ①, ②, and ③ in the preceding figure are also applicable to a zoomed-in chart.

   * View SQL request analysis: On the **Response time** trend chart, click **SQL Request Analysis** in the upper-right corner to view the request analysis details. For more information, see [View SQL request analysis](../../1000.diagnosis-and-tuning-fuctions/100.manage-sql-diagnosis/1300.view-request-analysis.md).

        <main id="notice" type='explain'>
        <h4>Note</h4>
        <p>SQL request analysis is available only on the <strong>Response time</strong> trend chart. </p>
        </main>

   * Drill down to view monitoring data in different dimensions: If you find an abnormal metric such as a long response time on the **Tenant Dimension** tab, perform drill-down analysis to identify the faulty server. Click the **Drill-down Analysis** icon in the upper-right corner of the trend chart to view the drill-down analysis details. The **OBKV_HBase** tab supports the following drill-down dimensions: **tenant > OBServer node**.

       The features indicated by ①, ②, and ③ in the preceding figure are also applicable to a trend chart on a drill-down page. You can also perform the following operations:

       ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/420/%E8%AF%8A%E6%96%AD%E4%B8%8B%E9%92%BB-1.png)

       * In the **Data Filtering** section indicated by ① in the figure, specify filter conditions. If you do not specify any filter conditions, the drill-down page automatically inherits filter conditions from the upper-level page.

       * If the metric has submetrics, you can view the submetrics or drill down to other dimensions, as indicated by ② in the figure.

       * The trend chart also provides an entry to the host performance monitoring feature. Hover the pointer over the **Go to Host Performance Monitoring** link, as indicated by ③ in the figure, and click the target host to go to its **Performance Monitoring** page and view the monitoring details.

       * You can also click the icon indicated by ④ in the upper-right corner of a trend chart, and select the hosts whose performance monitoring data needs to be displayed on the trend chart.
