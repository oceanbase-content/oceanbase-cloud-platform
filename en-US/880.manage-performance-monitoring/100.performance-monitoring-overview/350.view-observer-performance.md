# View OBServer node performance data

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to view the performance monitoring data of OBServer nodes in different dimensions by using the following methods:

* **Method 1:**

  1. Log in to the OCP console.

  2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters** to go to the **Clusters** page.

  3. In the **Clusters** list on the page that appears, find the target cluster and click its name.

  4. In the left-side navigation pane on the page that appears, click **Performance Monitoring**.

  5. On the **Cluster Performance** tab, view the performance monitoring data of OBServer nodes.

* **Method 2:**

  1. Log in to the OCP console.

  2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring**.

  3. The **OceanBase Cluster** page automatically appears.

  4. Click the **OBServer Performance** tab and view the performance monitoring data of OBServer nodes.

## Prerequisites

You have the read-only privilege on the target cluster.

## Procedure

The procedure of **Method 2** is described as follows:

1. Log in to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring**.

3. The **OceanBase Cluster** tab automatically appears.

4. In the **Data Filtering** section, configure the parameters for filtering monitoring data.

   The following table describes the filter parameters.

   |     Parameter  |  Description  |
   |---------------|---------|
   | Cluster | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select a cluster to view its monitoring information.  |
   | Zone | By default, the monitoring information of all zones is displayed. |
   | OBServer | By default, the monitoring information of all OBServer nodes is displayed. |
   | Select Time | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select the time range of the data that you want to query.  |
   | Auto Refresh | By default, the auto-refresh mode is disabled. After it is enabled, performance monitoring data is refreshed every 5 seconds. |

5. Click the **OBServer Performance** tab and view the performance monitoring data of OBServer nodes. If the statistical range covers multiple OBServer nodes, the aggregate metric values of the OBServer nodes are displayed.

   * OCP allows you to view OBServer node performance monitoring data in two dimensions: cluster and OBServer node. By default, the system displays the monitoring data in the cluster dimension. The metrics vary in different dimensions.
   * By default, the system displays all metrics in the current dimension. If you want to ignore a metric, click **Select Metric** on the right of the area and deselect the metric in the panel that appears.
   * For more information about the monitoring metrics, see [Overview of metrics](../../1900.reference-guide/300.monitoring-indicator-reference/100.overview-of-metrics.md).

   The following features enable you to better view and analyze the performance monitoring data on a trend chart. You can learn about the features with the help of the figure below.

   ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/434/01061506.png)

   1. Hide the data of a submetric: To use this feature, click the icon of the submetric. The submetric will then turn gray and its data will be hidden from the chart.

   2. View detailed data of a specific point in time or a period of time: You can hover the pointer over a point in time on the trend chart to view the detailed data. You can also drag the pointer to select a period of time on the trend chart and have a zoomed-in view of data in this period of time. To resume the normal view, double-click the trend chart.

   3. Zoom in on the trend chart: To use this feature, click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner. The features indicated by ①, ②, and ④ in the preceding figure are also applicable to a zoomed-in chart.

   4. Drill down to view monitoring data in different dimensions: If you find an abnormal metric such as high CPU utilization of a process on the **Cluster Dimension** tab, perform drill-down analysis to identify the faulty server. Click the **Drill-down Analysis** icon in the upper-right corner of the trend chart. The **OBServer Performance** tab supports the following drill-down dimensions: cluster > host.

      The features indicated by ① and ② in the preceding figure are also applicable to a trend chart on a drill-down page. You can also perform the following operations:

      ![1202](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/420/%E4%B8%BB%E6%9C%BA%E7%9B%91%E6%8E%A7-1.png)

      1. In the **Data Filtering** section of the drill-down page, specify filter conditions. If you do not specify any filter conditions, the drill-down page automatically inherits filter conditions from the upper-level page, as indicated by ① in the preceding figure.

      2. If the metric has submetrics, you can view the submetrics, as indicated by ② in the preceding figure, or click the link indicated by ③ to drill down to other dimensions for further analysis.

      3. If the metric is related to host performance, you can hover the pointer over the **Go to Host Performance Monitoring** link indicated by ③ in the preceding figure and click the IP address of a host to go to the **Monitoring** page of the host.

      4. You can also click the icon indicated by ④ in the upper-right corner of a trend chart, and select the hosts whose performance monitoring data needs to be displayed on the trend chart.

6. (Optional) Configure the monitoring data collection interval.

   By default, OCP collects monitoring data per second. This collection interval has high requirements for the OCP server performance and MonitorDB storage performance. If you do not require a high collection frequency, you can change the value of the `ocp.metric.collect.interval.second` parameter in the `config_properties` file to increase the monitoring data collection interval, thus reducing required resources and increasing the manageable scale.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The system supports only the following values for this parameter: 1, 5, 10, and 15. If the value you entered is not one of them, the system adjusts the value based on the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If the entered value is smaller than 1, it is adjusted to 1.</li>
    <li>If the entered value is in the range of [1, 5), it is adjusted to 1.</li>
    <li>If the entered value is in the range of [5, 10), it is adjusted to 5.</li>
    <li>If the entered value is in the range of [10, 15), it is adjusted to 10.</li>
    <li>If the entered value is greater than 15, it is adjusted to 15.</li>
    </ul>
    </main>

   After you change the value, the configuration immediately takes effect. OCP collects monitoring data at this new interval. By default, the monitoring data display interval is three times the monitoring data collection interval, except for the case when the collection interval is 1 second. For example, if the monitoring data is collected every 5 seconds, the queried monitoring data is displayed by an interval of 15 seconds.
