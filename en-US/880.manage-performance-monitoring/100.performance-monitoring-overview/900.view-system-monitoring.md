# View system monitoring data

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to view the system monitoring data of an OBProxy cluster by using the following methods:

* **Method 1:**

   Log in to the OCP console and go to the OBProxy overview page. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring**.

* **Method 2:**

   Log in to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring** to go to the **OBProxy Cluster** tab.

## Prerequisites

You have the read-only privilege on the target OBProxy cluster.

## Procedure

The procedure of **Method 2** is described as follows:

1. Log in to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Performance Monitoring**.

3. Click the **OBProxy Cluster** tab.

4. In the **Data Filtering** section, configure the parameters for filtering monitoring data.

   The following table describes the filter parameters.

   |     Parameter  |  Description  |
   |---------------|---------|
   | Cluster | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select an OBProxy cluster to view its monitoring data.  |
   | Time Range | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode. Select the time range of the data that you want to query.  |
   | Auto Refresh | By default, the auto-refresh mode is disabled. After it is enabled, performance monitoring data is refreshed every 10 seconds. |

   2. In the **Overview** section, view the monitoring trend charts of the current OBProxy cluster. The trend charts show the metrics related to the Linux system load, CPU utilization, I/O utilization, I/O queue length, IOPS, I/O time, I/O throughput, network throughput, TCP retransmission rate, network packets sent/received, NTP clock offset, Inode usage, memory, memory usage, disk, resident memory of the process, CPU utilization of the process, number of file descriptors for the process, number of threads in the process, and number of OCP-Agent process goroutines.

        The following features allow you to view and analyze the performance monitoring data on a trend chart in a more efficient manner. You can learn about the features with the help of the figure below.

        1. View the trend details of a metric over a specific period of time: To use this feature, drag the pointer over a period of time to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. To resume to the normal view, double-click the trend chart, as indicated by ① in the preceding figure.

        2. Hide the data of a submetric: To use this feature, click the icon of this submetric. The submetric will then turn gray and its data will be hidden from the chart, as indicated by ② in the preceding figure.

        3. View the detailed data of a specific point in time: To use this feature, hover the pointer over a point in time on the trend chart, as indicated by ③ in the preceding figure.

        4. Zoom in on the trend chart: To use this feature, click the zoom-in icon in the upper-right corner, as indicated by ④ in the preceding figure. The features indicated by ①, ②, and ③ in the preceding figure are also applicable to other monitoring trend charts.
