## Basic resource information

You can view the runtime status of OceanBase clusters, OceanBase Database tenants, OBProxy clusters, and hosts, and perform prompt O&M management on abnormal resources.

You can move the pointer over the question mark (**?**) next to **OceanBase Cluster** and view the statistics of CPU cores deployed for the cluster.
