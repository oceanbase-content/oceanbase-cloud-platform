# OCP metrics

## Expressions of OCP metrics

An expression of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) is a template in a PromQL-like syntax. Expressions are used to calculate the sequential data of the corresponding collection items. Here are some examples.

| Metric | Expression |
|------------------|--------|
| qps | sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40000",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) |
| qps_rt | sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40001",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) / sum(rate(ob_sysstat{stat_id="40000",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS) |

`@LABELS`, `@INTERVAL`, and `@GBLABELS` are wildcards that can be replaced with actual query conditions as needed. For example, you can replace the wildcards in the `avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total_native{mode="idle",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS)` expression based on the actual conditions as follows:

```SQL
100 * avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total_native{mode="idle",svr_ip="xxx.xxx.xxx.1"}[1])) by (svr_ip)
100 * avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total_native{mode="idle",svr_ip="xxx.xxx.xxx.2"}[1])) by (svr_ip)
100 * avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total_native{mode="idle",svr_ip="xxx.xxx.xxx.3"}[1])) by (svr_ip)
```

### Wildcards

| Wildcard | Description |
|------------------|--------|
| @LABELS | The label for filtering. It can be replaced with actual conditions such as `ob_cluster_id="1"` and `svr_ip="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"`.  |
| @INTERVAL | The range vector selector for range queries in PromQL. It can be used by only functions such as rate() and delta().  |
| @GBLABELS | The dimension based on which aggregation is performed. It can be replaced with actual conditions such as `ob_cluster_id` and `svr_ip`, and is similar to the `GROUP BY` clause in the SQL syntax.  |

The `sum(metric{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS)` expression, for example, specifies to aggregate the metrics based on the GBLABELS condition to obtain the sum.

The following table describes general Prometheus functions supported by expressions in OCP:

| Function | Description |
|--------|--------|
| abs | Returns the absolute value of values provided. |
| sum | Returns the sum of values provided. |
| avg | Returns the average value of values provided. |
| min | Returns the minimum value among values provided. |
| max | Returns the maximum value among values provided. |
| count | Returns the count of values. |
| rate | Returns the average growth rate per second. |
| delta | Returns the difference between the first and last values of time-series elements. |
| round | Returns the integer that is nearest to the value provided. |
