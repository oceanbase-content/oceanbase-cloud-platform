Performance monitoring 
===========================================

This topic describes the tenant performance monitoring feature of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). 

Prerequisite 
---------------------------------

You have created a new tenant. For more information, see [Create a tenant](2.basic-tenant-operations/2.create-a-tenant-1.md).

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OCP console.

   

2. Select **Tenants** to go to the **Tenants** page.

   

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the target tenant and click its name.

   

4. In the left-side navigation pane on the page that appears, click **Performance Monitoring** .

   

5. In the **Data Filtering** section, you can view the performance data by performing the following steps: 

   The following table describes the filter conditions.

   | Select Time (not displayed in real-time mode) | Select a time range for the data that you want to query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
   | Stat Period (not displayed in real-time mode) | Specify the length of the statistical period of a performance data point. The value can be **Per Minute** or **Per Second** , indicating that the performance statistics are in the one-minute or one-second granule.  OCP also calculates a statistical period of a data point based on the specified time range following the principle that approximately 1440 data points will be returned in total. If you specify a long time range, the actual statistical period may be longer than 1 minute. |
   | Zone                                          | Select the zone that you want to view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | OBServer                                      | Select the OBServer that you want to view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

   
   * After you specify the filter conditions, the system displays the performance monitoring data based on the selected period and statistical period.

     **Note**

     

     To view the trend details over a specific period, drag the pointer over the period to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. After you view the trend details, double-click the trend chart to return to normal.
     
   
   * To view the performance data of an OBServer in real time, toggle on the **Real-time** switch in the upper-right corner and select the target OBServer.
