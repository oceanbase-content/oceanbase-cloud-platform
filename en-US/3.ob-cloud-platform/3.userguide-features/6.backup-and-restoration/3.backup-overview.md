On the Backup Overview page, you can perform the following actions:

* [New Backup Strategy](t2009328.md#topic-2009328): create a backup strategy for backup scheduling.

  

* [Back up Now](t2009329.md#topic-2009329): initiate a cluster backup task.

  

* View backup tasks:

  You can filter Data Backup Tasks, Log Backup Tasks, and Cleanup Tasks of regular backups by time. You can also start or stop a task.
  

* View secondary backup tasks:

  You can filter Data Backup Tasks and Log Backup Tasks of secondary backups by time, and can start or stop a task.
