Backup and recovery overview 
=================================================

On the Overview page, you can view the core metrics and alerts of backup and restoration, backup storage trends, and information about clusters that have or have not been backed up. You can also go to the corresponding pages to initiate restoration tasks and immediate backup tasks, create backup policies and restoration sampling policies, and launch the backup and restoration wizard. 

**Core metrics** 
-------------------------------------

In the Core Metrics section, you can view **Number of Clusters with Backup Policies, Weekly Data Backup Success Rate, Objects with Log Backup Latency** , and **Weekly Successful Restoration Sampling Tasks** .![1](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1914306461/p393989.png)

**Alerts** 
-------------------------------

In the Alerts section, you can filter alerts by time range. The total number of alerts in the specified time range is displayed in the ring chart on the left, and the table on the right displays the following information about the alerts: **ID, Object, Alert Type, Generated At, Recovered At, Last Generated At** , and **Status** . You can further filter the alerts by status. You can click the ID of an alert to view details of the alert. ![2](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1914306461/p393990.png)

**Backup storage trends** 
----------------------------------------------

In the Backup Storage Trends section, you can select a time range to view the backup storage trends from the perspective of **Total Volume, Data Backup** , and **Log Backup** . You can filter the chart by time to view the backup storage tendency chart in a specific time range. You can also move the pointer over a specific points in time on the curve to view the backup storage data.![3](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1914306461/p393991.png)

**Cluster Backed Up** 
------------------------------------------
