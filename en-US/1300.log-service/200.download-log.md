## Log types

The following table describes the log types.

| Log type | Description |
|---------|-----|
| OBServer Logs | All logs in the `/log/` directory of the installation path. The log clearing strategy is determined by the value you specified for the `ocp.agent.ob-cleaner.config` parameter:<ul><li> The logs are not cleared when the log disk usage is less than the threshold, which is 80% by default.    </li><li> If the log disk usage exceeds the threshold, the system first clears logs that were generated before the specified time.  </li><li> If the log disk usage is less than the threshold after the logs generated before the specified time are cleared, the clearing stops.    </li><li> Otherwise, logs are deleted based on the retention percentage.   </li></ul> |
| OBProxy Logs | All logs in the `/home/admin/logs/obproxy/log/` directory.  |
