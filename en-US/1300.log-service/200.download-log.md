# Download logs

This topic describes how to download logs.

## Access paths

You can access the **Log Search** page from the following paths and specify the search criteria to download required logs:

* On the **Overview** page of a cluster, hover over the More icon in the upper-right corner and select **Download Logs** from the drop-down list.

* On the **Overview** page of an OBProxy cluster, hover over the More icon in the upper-right corner and select **Download All Logs** from the drop-down list.

* On the **Basic Information** tab of the host details page, click **Download Logs**.

* On the **Log Query** page of **Log Service**, click **Download Logs** in the upper-right corner of the log query result.

## Specify the time range

You can select last 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes, last 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours, or last 7 days from the current time, or specify a time range, to download logs generated within the specified time range.

## Specify the object scope

You can view the logs of an OceanBase cluster, an arbitration service, an OBProxy cluster, a binlog server, a binlog instance, or a host.

## Specify the log type

The following table describes the log types.

| Log type | Description |
|--------------------|--------|
| OceanBase Database logs | All logs in the `/log/` directory of the OceanBase cluster installation path, subdivided into four types: `observer`, `rootservice`, `election`, and `alert`. </br>The log clearing strategy is determined by the value you specified for the `ocp.agent.ob-cleaner.config` parameter:<ul><li> The logs are not cleared when the log disk usage is less than the threshold, which is 80% by default.   </li><li> If the log disk usage exceeds the threshold, the system first clears logs that were generated before the specified time. </li><li> If the log disk usage is less than the threshold after the logs generated before the specified time are cleared, the clearing stops.   </li><li> Otherwise, logs are deleted based on the retention percentage.  </li></ul> |
| Arbitration service logs | All logs in the `/log/` directory of the arbitration service installation path, subdivided into three types: `arbitration_observer`, `arbitration_rootservice`, and `arbitration_election`. |
| OBProxy logs | All logs in the `/home/admin/logs/obproxy/log/` directory, subdivided into eight types: `obproxy`, `obproxy_digest`, `obproxy_stat`, `obproxy_slow`, `obproxy_limit`, `obproxy_diagnosis`, `obproxy_xflush`, and `obproxy_error`.  |
| Binlog server logs | All `binlog_server_logproxy` logs in the `/log/` directory of the binlog cluster installation path.  |
| Binlog instance logs | All logs in the `/run/instance name/log/` directory of the binlog cluster installation path, subdivided into four types: `binlog_service_instance`, `binlog_service_init`, `binlog_service_libobcdc`, and `binlog_service_libobcdc_stderr`. |
| Host logs | All **message-date** files in the `/var/log` directory.  |
| OCP Agent logs | All logs in the `/home/admin/ocp_agent/log/` directory, subdivided into four types: `mgragent`, `monagent`, `agentctl`, and `agentd`. |

## Specify the keywords

You can specify one or more keywords in the **Include** or **Exclude** search box for case-insensitive exact match during log filtering. This operation is optional.

* Specify keywords in the **Include** search box: Logs containing the keywords will be returned during log search. Regular expression matching and general matching of multiple keywords are supported.
* Specify keywords in the **Exclude** search box: Logs containing the keywords will be filtered out during log search. Multiple keywords can be excluded.

## Specify the log level

You can select an alert level from the drop-down list. Seven alert levels are available: ERROR, WARN, INFO, WDIAG, EDIAG, TRACE, and DEBUG. This operation is optional.
