# View details on the OBProxy page

OBProxy can forward user-initiated data access requests to the corresponding OBServer node. OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to create an OBProxy cluster, view information about the OBProxy clusters, and view the OBProxy monitoring information.

## View OBProxy clusters

In the OBProxy cluster list, you can view information about OBProxy clusters in the following columns: **Name**, **Tag**, **Deployment Mode**, **Connectable OceanBase Clusters**, **Access URL**, **Port**, **Version**, **Status**, and **Created At**.

* You can click the name of an OBProxy cluster in the **Name** column to go to the overview page of the cluster.

* You can filter the OBProxy clusters by status.

* You can hover the pointer over the **Tag** column of an OBProxy cluster to view all its tags. You can click the Edit icon to manage the tags. For more information, see [Manage tags](../1600.system-management-features/800.manage-tags/100.tags-overview.md).

* You can [create an OBProxy cluster](200.create-an-obproxy-cluster.md), [take over an OBProxy cluster](400.manage-a-obproxy-server/200.take-over-an-obproxy.md), [add an OBProxy cluster](400.manage-a-obproxy-server/100.add-an-obproxy.md), [delete an OBProxy cluster](300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/500.delete-an-obproxy-cluster.md), [stop or restart an OBProxy cluster](400.manage-a-obproxy-server/450.stop-or-start-an-obproxy.md), and [migrate an OBProxy cluster](300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/450.migrate-an-obproxy-cluster.md).

## Top 5 OBProxy clusters

In the **OBProxy Monitoring Top5** section, you can view relevant information in the following charts: **TPS**, **QPS**, **Client Connections**, **Server Connections**, **SQL Response Time**, **Route table queries**, and **Net bytes**. You can click **Last 1 Hour** and select **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, or **Last 7 Days** to view the monitoring data in the corresponding period.
