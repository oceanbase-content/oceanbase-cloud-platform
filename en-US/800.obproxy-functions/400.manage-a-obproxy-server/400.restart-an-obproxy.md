# Restart an ODP

This topic describes how to restart an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP). During the restart of an ODP, the ODP stops providing services. Proceed with caution.

If you have configured Server Load Balancer (SLB) instances for the ODP cluster, and other functional ODPs are available in the cluster, business requests can be forwarded to the functional ODPs by SLB instances. This avoids business interruptions due to the ODP restart.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

* In ODP earlier than V3.2.1, only the **Force Restart** mode is supported. In ODP V3.2.1 and later, the **Force Restart** and **Restart** modes are supported.

* An ODP supports the **Restart** mode only in the **Running** state, and supports the **Force Restart** mode in other states.

* A force restart will first stop the ODP. We recommend that you perform the operation when the business traffic is low.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, select the target ODP cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Find the ODP that you want to restart, and choose **More > Restart** in the **Actions** column.

   You can also select multiple ODPs and click **Batch Restart**.

   To restart all ODPs in an ODP cluster, you can directly restart the cluster. For more information, see [Restart an ODP cluster](../300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/700.restarts-all-obproxy-nodes-in-the-obproxy-cluster.md).

5. In the dialog box that appears, select **Restart** or **Force Restart**.

   * **Restart** (recommended): By default, business access to the database is not interrupted during a restart. If your business involves long-running transactions, we recommend that you set the `hot_upgrade_exit_timeout` parameter to an appropriate value or ensure that application connections can be retried.
   * **Force Restart**: The client that connects to the ODP is disconnected, which results in business interruptions.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the ODP is displayed as **Running** in the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page, the ODP is restarted.
