# Restart an OBProxy

This topic describes how to restart an OBProxy. During the restart of an OBProxy, the OBProxy stops providing services. Proceed with caution.

If you have configured Server Load Balancer (SLB) instances for the OBProxy cluster, and other functional OBProxies are available in the cluster, business requests can be forwarded to the functional OBProxies by SLB instances. This avoids business interruptions due to the OBProxy restart.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

* In OBProxy earlier than V3.2.1, only the **Force Restart** mode is supported. In OBProxy V3.2.1 and later, the **Force Restart** and **Restart** modes are supported.

* An OBProxy supports the **Restart** mode only in the **Running** state, and supports the **Force Restart** mode in other states.

* A force restart will first stop the OBProxy. We recommend that you perform the operation when the business traffic is low.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, select the target OBProxy cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Find the OBProxy that you want to restart, and choose **More > Restart** in the **Actions** column.

   You can also select multiple OBProxies and click **Batch Restart**.

   To restart all OBProxies in an OBProxy cluster, you can directly restart the cluster. For more information, see [Restart an OBProxy cluster](../300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/700.restarts-all-obproxy-nodes-in-the-obproxy-cluster.md).

5. In the dialog box that appears, select **Restart** or **Force Restart**.

   * **Restart** (recommended): By default, business access to the database is not interrupted during a restart. If your business involves long-running transactions, we recommend that you set the `hot_upgrade_exit_timeout` parameter to an appropriate value or ensure that application connections can be retried.
   * **Force Restart**: The client that connects to the OBProxy is disconnected, which results in business interruptions.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the OBProxy is displayed as **Running** in the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page, the OBProxy is restarted.
