# Remove an OBProxy

This topic describes how to remove an OBProxy. After an OBProxy is removed, the weight of the node in the load balancer decreases to 0. This node is no longer the traffic entry for new connections. The performance may be affected. Proceed with caution.

## Prerequisites

* You are logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.
* The target OBProxy is in the pending takeover or deletion state.
* The target OBProxy is launched.
* The OBProxy cluster contains at least one load balancer instance.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster. Then, the **Overview** page of the OBProxy cluster appears.

4. In the OBProxy list, select the target OBProxy, move the pointer over the **More** icon, and then click **Remove** in the drop-down list.

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Remove**.

6. After the OBProxy is offline, you can hover the cursor over the **Offline** icon of the OBProxy to view the prompts. You can also click **View SLB Instances** in the prompts to view the load balancing configuration of the OBProxy.
