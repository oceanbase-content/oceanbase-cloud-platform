<p>If a host in the OBProxy cluster is offline, the system cannot clean up the host environment and will skip this step during the deletion of the OBProxy cluster. In this case, we recommend that you manually clean up the host environment. </p>

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the `OBPROXY_MANAGER` role.

* Make sure that deleting the target OBProxy does not impact your business.

  * No connectable OceanBase cluster is configured for the cluster where the target OBProxy is located, or the configured connectable OceanBase cluster is deprecated.

  * The cluster where the target OBProxy is located has other functional OBProxies. You have forwarded requests from the target OBProxy to the functional OBProxies through Server Load Balancer (SLB) instances.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, click the target OBProxy cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Find the OBProxy to delete in the OBProxies list, and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.

   You can also select multiple OBProxies and then click **More** and select **Batch Delete**.

   To delete all OBProxies in the OBProxy cluster, you can directly delete the cluster. For more information, see [Delete an OBProxy cluster](../300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/500.delete-an-obproxy-cluster.md).

5. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** and then click **Delete**.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task status changes to **Completed** and the OBProxy disappears from the OBProxy list on the **Overview** page of the cluster, the OBProxy is deleted.
