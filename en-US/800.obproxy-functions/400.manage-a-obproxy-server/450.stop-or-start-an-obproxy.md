# Stop or start an OBProxy

This topic describes how to stop or start an OBProxy. Stopping an OBProxy causes business interruptions. Proceed with caution.

After you stop an OBProxy, you can click **Start** to restart it.

## Prerequisites

You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, select the target OBProxy cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Find the OBProxy that you want to stop, and choose **More > Stop** in the **Actions** column.

   To stop all OBProxies in an OBProxy cluster, you can directly stop the cluster. For more information, see [Stop or start an OBProxy cluster](../300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/700.restarts-all-obproxy-nodes-in-the-obproxy-cluster.md).

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the OBProxy is displayed as **Stopped** in the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page, the task is successfully executed.

7. Start the OBProxy.

   If you want to use the stopped OBProxy again, find the OBProxy in the **OBProxies** list, and choose **More > Start** in the **Actions** column. You can also select multiple OBProxies and click **Batch Start**.
