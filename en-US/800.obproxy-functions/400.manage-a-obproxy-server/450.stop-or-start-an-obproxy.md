# Stop or start an ODP

This topic describes how to stop or start an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP). Stopping an ODP causes business interruptions. Proceed with caution.

After you stop an ODP, you can click **Start** to restart it.

## Prerequisites

You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, select the target ODP cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Find the ODP that you want to stop, and choose **More > Stop** in the **Actions** column.

   You can also select multiple ODPs and click **Batch Stop**.

   To stop all ODPs in an ODP cluster, you can directly stop the cluster. For more information, see [Stop or start an ODP cluster](../300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/700.restarts-all-obproxy-nodes-in-the-obproxy-cluster.md).

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of the ODP is displayed as **Stopped** in the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page, the task is successfully executed.

7. Start the ODP.

   If you want to use the stopped ODP again, find the ODP in the **OBProxies** list, and choose **More > Start** in the **Actions** column. You can also select multiple ODPs and click **Batch Start**.
