# Refresh OBProxy configurations

This topic describes how to refresh OBProxy configurations. You can refresh the OBProxy configurations to synchronize the parameter settings of an OBProxy with those of the OBProxy cluster.

## Prerequisites

* The logged-on user in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console uses the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

* In the OBProxies list on the Overview page of the OBProxy cluster, if the **Status** of an OBProxy is **Running** , and an exclamation point ( **!** ) is displayed in its **Parameter Version** column, it means that the parameter version of this OBProxy is different from that of the OBProxy cluster. In this case, you need to refresh the configurations of this OBProxy.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** .

3. In the OBProxy cluster list, click the target OBProxy cluster to go to the **Overview** page of that OBProxy cluster.

4. Find the target OBProxy in the OBProxies list. Click **More > Refresh Configurations** in the **Actions** column.

   If you want to refresh the configurations of multiple OBProxies, select target OBProxies and click **More > Batch Refresh** .

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** .

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task status is **Completed** , and the **Parameter Version** column of the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page does not contain an exclamation point ( **!** ), the OBProxy configurations are refreshed.
