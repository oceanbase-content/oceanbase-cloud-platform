# Take over an OBProxy

This topic describes how to take over an OceanBase Proxy (OBProxy) to an OBProxy cluster managed by the current OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). An OBProxy that is not managed by the current OCP is called an OBProxy to be taken over, and the OBProxy cluster to take over an OBProxy is called the target OBProxy cluster. Once an OBProxy is taken over to the target OBProxy cluster, it will be operated and maintained by the current OCP together with the OBProxy cluster.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OCP console as the `OBPROXY_MANAGER` role.

* The OBProxy to be taken over must meet the following requirements:

  * Its version is V1.8.0 or later.

  * It is installed by using the standard RPM package, and the installation path is `/opt/taobao/install/obproxy-{version}`.

  * The OBProxy host has only one `obproxy` process, and the process belongs to the administrator.

  * It is accessible by the network where the OCP is located.

  * The OBProxy host has been added to the OCP. For information about how to add a host to the OCP, see [Add a host](../../850.host-features/200.add-a-host.md).

* There is an existing target OBProxy cluster in the current OCP that meets the following requirements:

  * Its startup mode is the same as that of the OBProxy to be taken over.

      For example, if the startup mode of the target OBProxy cluster is `ConfigUrl`, that of the OBProxy to be taken over must also be `ConfigUrl`.

  * The connectable OceanBase clusters of the OBProxy to be taken over must be a subset of or the same as those of the target OBProxy cluster.

    * If the startup mode of the target OBProxy cluster is `ConfigUrl`, the connectable OceanBase clusters of the OBProxy to be taken over must be a subset of connectable OceanBase clusters of the target OBProxy cluster.

    * If the startup mode of the target OBProxy cluster is `RootService list`, the connectable OceanBase clusters of the OBProxy to be taken over must be the same as those of the target OBProxy cluster.

   If there is no OBProxy cluster in the current OCP that meets the requirements, create an eligible empty OBProxy cluster. For information about how to create an OBProxy cluster, see [Create an OBProxy cluster](../../500.quickstart/800.quickstart-create-an-obproxy-cluster.md).

* If the current OBProxy cluster is version V4.0 or above, it only supports taking over OBProxy versions V4.0.0 and above. If the current OBProxy cluster is version V3.x or below, it only supports taking over OBProxy versions above V1.8 and below V4.0.0.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. Click **OBProxy**.

3. Navigate to the **OBProxy Takeover** page through the following two methods:

   * Method 1: In the **Clusters** list, find an OBProxy cluster to take over the OBProxy, and then click **Take over OBProxy** in the **Actions** column.

   * Method 2: In the **Clusters** list, click the name of the target OBProxy cluster to take over the OBProxy. On the displayed **Overview** page, click **Take over OBProxy** in the upper-right corner.

      ![08261706](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/420/420-en/%E6%8E%A5%E7%AE%A1OBProxy%E6%B3%952.png)

4. On the **OBProxy Takeover** page that appears, select the host where the OBProxy to be taken over is deployed.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |---------------|--------------|
   | **root@proxysys Password** | Enter the password of the administrator account for the OBProxy. If you did not change the password, you do not need to specify this parameter now. <main id="explain" type='alert'><h4>Note</h4><p>If multiple OBProxies are to be taken over and the passwords for these OBProxies are different, we recommend that you take over OBProxies that have the same password in a batch. </p></main> |
   | **Data Center** | Select the data center to which the OBProxy belongs. An OBProxy can belong to only one IDC.  |
   | **Host Type** |  After you select a host type, the host list is filtered based on the host type.  |
   | **Host** | Select the host where the OBProxy is deployed.  |
   | **SQL Port Number** | Select the SQL port of the host where the OBProxy is deployed.  |

5. Click **Next**.

   The system performs a precheck on the OBProxies to be taken over and displays the check result on the precheck page.

   If the precheck fails, the takeover cannot proceed. In this case, perform the following steps:

   * Remove the OBProxies that fail the precheck based on the actual situation and take over only the OBProxies that pass the precheck.

   * Move the pointer over the `Cause` icon in the **Check Result** column to view the cause of the failure. After you fix the problem, click **Recheck**.

   When all OBProxies in the list pass the precheck, proceed to Step 6.

6. Click **Take over All**.

   <main id="explain" type='alert'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>For ease of management, after the target OBProxy is taken over, its root@proxysys password will be set to the same as the root@proxysys password of the target OBProxy cluster . </p>
   </main>

   If the takeover task is executed successfully, the takeover is completed.
