# Delete an OBProxy cluster

This topic describes how to delete an OceanBase Proxy (OBProxy) cluster. After an OBProxy cluster is deleted, the OBProxies in the cluster are uninstalled from each host, and the resources occupied by the OBProxies on each host are released. Settings of the OBProxy cluster and related OceanBase Load Balancer (OBLB) are also deleted.

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>If a host in the OBProxy cluster is offline, the system cannot clean up the host environment and will skip this step during the deletion of the OBProxy cluster. In this case, we recommend that you manually clean up the host environment. </p>

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the `OBPROXY_MANAGER` role.

* Make sure that the current OBProxy cluster no longer provides the reverse proxy service.

   The **Connectable OceanBase Clusters** list of the OBProxy cluster is empty, or the listed OceanBase clusters are deprecated.

## Procedure

You can delete an OBProxy cluster by using the following two methods:

* **Method 1**: Go to the **OBProxy** page, find the OBProxy cluster that you want to delete, and choose **More > Delete** in the **Actions** column.
* **Method 2**: Go to the **Overview** page of the OBProxy cluster that you want to delete, move the pointer over the **More** icon, and click **Delete Cluster**.

The following procedure takes **Method 2** as an example.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, click the target OBProxy cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Move the pointer over the **More** icon and click **Delete Cluster**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete**.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the deleted OBProxy cluster does not exist in the **Clusters** list on the **OBProxy** page, the cluster is successfully deleted.
