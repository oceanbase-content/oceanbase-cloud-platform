# Delete an ODP cluster

This topic describes how to delete an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) cluster. After an ODP cluster is deleted, the ODPs in the cluster are uninstalled from each host, and the resources occupied by the ODPs on each host are released. Settings of the ODP cluster and related OceanBase Load Balancer (OBLB) are also deleted.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

* Make sure that the current ODP cluster no longer provides the reverse proxy service.

   The **Connectable OceanBase Clusters** list of the ODP cluster is empty, or the listed OceanBase clusters are deprecated.

## Procedure

You can delete an ODP cluster by using the following two methods:

* **Method 1**: Go to the **OBProxy** page, find the ODP cluster that you want to delete, and choose **More > Delete** in the **Actions** column.
* **Method 2**: Go to the **Overview** page of the ODP cluster that you want to delete, move the pointer over the **More** icon, and click **Delete Cluster**.

The following procedure demonstrates how to use **Method 2**.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, select the target ODP cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Move the pointer over the **More** icon and click **Delete Cluster**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete**.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the deleted ODP cluster does not exist in the **Clusters** list on the **OBProxy** page, the cluster is successfully deleted.
