# Manage load balancing

OBLB is a software load balancing tool that is based on iptables. You can configure OBLB for an OBProxy cluster to improve its load balancing capability.

* If the OBLB service is not configured for an OBProxy cluster, you can click **Add Load Balancing** to add the OBLB service for it.
* If the OBLB service is already configured for an OBProxy cluster, you can click **Modify Load Balancing** to update the related OBLB information.

## Prerequisites

* You are logged on to the OCP console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

* OBLB has been deployed in OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) before you add the OBLB service. For more information, see [Deploy OBLB](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oat-doc-cn-10000000001092549).
