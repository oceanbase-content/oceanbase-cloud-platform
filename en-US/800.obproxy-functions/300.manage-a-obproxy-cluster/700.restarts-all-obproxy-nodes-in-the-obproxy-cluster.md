# Restart an ODP cluster

This topic describes how to restart an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) cluster. If you restart an ODP cluster, all ODPs in the cluster are restarted.

To restart an ODP cluster that provides services, we recommend that you restart ODPs in the cluster in batches based on your load-balancing strategy. For more information, see [Restart an ODP](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/400.restart-an-obproxy.md).

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the OBPROXY_MANAGER role.

* In ODP earlier than V3.2.1, only the **Force Restart** mode is supported. In ODP V3.2.1 and later, the **Force Restart** and **Restart** modes are supported.

* The **Restart** mode is supported only when all ODPs in the ODP cluster are in the **Running** state. Otherwise, only **Force Restart** is supported.

* A force restart will first stop all ODPs in the ODP cluster. We recommend that you perform the operation when the business traffic is low.

## Procedure

You can restart an ODP cluster by using the following two methods:

* **Method 1**: Go to the **OBProxy** page, find the ODP cluster that you want to restart, and choose **More > Restart All** in the **Actions** column.
* **Method 2**: Go to the **Overview** page of the ODP cluster that you want to restart, and click **Restart All**.

The following procedure demonstrates how to use **Method 2**.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, select the target ODP cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Click **Restart All**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, select **Restart** or **Force Restart**.

   * **Restart** (recommended): By default, business access to the database is not interrupted during a restart. If your business involves long-running transactions, we recommend that you set the `hot_upgrade_exit_timeout` parameter to an appropriate value or ensure that application connections can be retried.
   * **Force Restart**: The client that connects to the ODP cluster is disconnected, which results in business interruptions.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task enters the **Completed** state, and the status of all ODPs is displayed as **Running** in the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page, the ODP cluster is restarted.
