This topic describes how to migrate an OBProxy cluster from one OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster to another.

</main>

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OCP console and are assigned the `OBPROXY_MANAGER` role.

* The cluster to be migrated is in the **RUNNING** state.

* If other services are deployed on the host where the OBProxy cluster is deployed, you cannot delete this host from the OCP cluster when you migrate the OBProxy cluster.

## Procedure

OCP provides two entries for you to migrate an OBProxy cluster:

* **Entry 1**: Go to the **OBProxy** page, locate the target OBProxy cluster in the cluster list, click More in the **Actions** column, and choose **Migrate Cluster**.

* **Entry 2**: Go to the **Overview** page of the target OBProxy cluster, hover the pointer over the **More** icon, and click **Migrate Cluster**.

The following procedure takes **Entry 2** as an example.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, click the target OBProxy cluster to go to its **Overview** page.

4. Hover the pointer over the **More** icon and then click **Migrate Cluster**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, perform the following operations:

   1. Export the information about the load balancers used by the OBProxy cluster.

      You can click **Export** or **Move Out** to export relevant load balancer data. If you want to retain the original load balancer configurations in the OBProxy cluster, you can import this file when you take over the OBProxy cluster. This way, you do not need to configure the same load balancer information again. For more information, see [Take over an OBProxy](../200.create-an-obproxy-cluster.md).

   2. Select the host where the cluster is deployed and delete it from the OCP cluster.

      Before you take over the OBProxy cluster in a new OCP cluster, you must delete the host from the original OCP cluster. You can also delete the host on the **Hosts** page. For more information, see [Delete a host](../../850.host-features/550.delete-a-host.md).

   3. Enter **move out** in the textbox and click **Move Out** to submit a task to migrate the OBProxy cluster.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **View Task** to view the migration progress.

   After the task status changes to **Completed**, and the OBProxy cluster disappears from the cluster list on the **OBProxy** page, the OBProxy cluster is migrated.
