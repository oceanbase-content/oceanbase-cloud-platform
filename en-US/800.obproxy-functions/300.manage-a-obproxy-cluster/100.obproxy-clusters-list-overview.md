# View details on the Overview page of an OBProxy cluster

On the **Overview** page of an OBProxy cluster, you can view the basic information, OBProxy list, and connectable OceanBase clusters of the OBProxy cluster, and perform basic O&M operations.

## View the basic information

In the **Basic Information** section, you can view the startup method, deployment mode, creator, access URL, parameter version, number of OBProxies not refreshed, and tags of the OBProxy cluster. You can perform the following operations in this section:

* Hover the pointer over the **Tag** field of an OBProxy cluster to view all its tags. You can click the **Edit** icon to manage the tags. For more information, see [Manage tags](../../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-tags/100.tags-overview.md).

* Copy the ConfigUrl, manage load balancing, and perform common OBProxy O&M operations. For more information, see [Take over an OBProxy](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/200.take-over-an-obproxy.md), [Add an OBProxy](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/100.add-an-obproxy.md), [Add a connectable OceanBase cluster](200.add-a-connectable-oceanbase-cluster.md), [Upgrade an OBProxy cluster](600.upgrade-an-obproxy-cluster.md), [Manage CPU core binding configurations](630.obproxy-cpu-core-binding-configuration.md), [Stop an OBProxy cluster](650.stop-an-obproxy-cluster.md), [Restart an OBProxy cluster](700.restarts-all-obproxy-nodes-in-the-obproxy-cluster.md), [Download logs](../../1300.log-service/200.download-log.md), [Manage load balancing](300.manage-load-balancing.md), [Change the password of the proxysys user](350.change-the-password.md), [Change the password of the proxyro user](400.change-the-password-of-the-proxyro-user.md), and [Delete a cluster](500.delete-an-obproxy-cluster.md).

## View OBProxies

In the **OBProxies** section, you can view the IP address, SQL port, version, parameter version, last available time, and status of each OBProxy. You can click the plus sign (+) to view the Exporter port, IDC, and CPU architecture of each OBProxy. You can perform the following operations in this section:

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>An OBProxy cluster that consists of OBProxies of different versions has stability risks. We recommend that all OBProxies in an OBProxy cluster be of the same version. </p>
</main>

* Filter OBProxies by status.
* Perform common O&M operations. For more information, see [Upgrade an OBProxy cluster](600.upgrade-an-obproxy-cluster.md), [Restart an OBProxy](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/400.restart-an-obproxy.md), [Stop/Start an OBProxy](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/450.stop-or-start-an-obproxy.md), [Refresh OBProxy configurations](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/800.refresh-obproxy-configurations.md), [Remove an OBProxy](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/500.remove-an-obproxy.md), [Launch an OBProxy](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/600.launch-an-obproxy.md), [Download logs](../../1300.log-service/200.download-log.md), and [Delete an OBProxy](../400.manage-a-obproxy-server/300.delete-an-obproxy.md).

## View connectable OceanBase clusters

In the **Connectable OceanBase Clusters** section, you can view the name, connection user, number of connections, and status of each connectable OceanBase cluster. You can perform the following operations in this section:

* Filter the OceanBase clusters by status.
* Delete a connected OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Delete a connected OceanBase cluster](800.delete-a-connected-oceanbase-cluster.md).
