# Create an OBProxy cluster

You can create an OBProxy cluster by specifying its basic information, deployment mode, and advanced settings. Then, you can add OBProxies to the OBProxy cluster or connect the OBProxy cluster to an OceanBase cluster.

## Prerequisites

You have the OBPROXY_MANAGER role or the permissions to manage OBProxies.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** to go to the OBProxy page.

3. Click **Create OBProxy Cluster** in the upper-right corner. The **Create OBProxy Cluster** page appears.

4. Specify the parameters of the OBProxy cluster in the **Basic Information** section.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |------|------|
   | Cluster Name | You can customize the cluster name. The value must start with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_).  |
   | root@proxysys Password  | The password of the root@proxysys account used to log on to the OBProxy for managing proxy parameters. This password can be customized or randomly generated. The password must meet the following complexity requirements: <ul><li>It must be 8 to 32 characters long. </li><li>It must contains at least three of the following character types: digits(0\~9), uppercase letters(A\~Z), lowercase letters(a\~z), and special characters (ie: <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=\|(){}[]:;,.?/</code>).  </li></ul>  |
   | Software Version  | The OBProxy software version. <ul><li>If the required version is available in the drop-down list, simply choose it from the list.    </li><li>If the required version is unavailable in the drop-down list, click **Add Version** at the bottom of the drop-down list to upload the required version. </li> </ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>You can only select OBProxy software packages of V1.8.0 or later. For security reasons, it is recommended to choose the software package of V3.1.0 or later.</p></main> |
   | Enter the password of the proxyro user  | The password of the proxyro account for OBProxy to access an OceanBase Database cluster. This parameter is displayed only when the software version of OBProxy is earlier than V4.0. If this parameter is not specified, the default password of the proxyro account will be used. The password must meet the following complexity requirements: <ul><li>It must be 8 to 32 characters long. </li><li>It must contains at least three of the following character types: digits(0\~9), uppercase letters(A\~Z), lowercase letters(a\~z), and special characters (ie: <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=\|(){}[]:;,.?/</code>).  </li></ul>  |
   | Manage Load Balancer | After load balancing management is enabled, you can configure OceanBase Load Balancer (OBLB) to improve the load balancing capability of an OBProxy cluster. <ul><li>**OBLB Service**: You can select the OBLB service configured when OCP is deployed, or click **Add OBLB Service** and then add the OBLB service on the right-side pane. For more information, see **Add a load balancer** in [Manage load balancing](300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/300.manage-load-balancing.md). <ul><li>**OBLB Service Address**: the address of the OBLB service. </li><li>**OBLB Service Port**: the port of the OBLB service. The default service port is 9090. You can change the service port as needed. </li><li>**Username & Password**: the username and password of the OBLB service, which are used to get the authentication information about the OBLB interface. </li></ul></li><li>**VIP**: the virtual IP address of the OBLB service. </li><li>**Access Port**: The default access port is 2883. You can change the access port. </li><li>**Domain Name Configuration (optional)**: the configuration that points to the virtual IP address (VIP) and port. The platform does not provide the mappings between VIPs and domain names. You must configure the domain name resolution service. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p><ul><li>This topic applies only to OceanBase Cloud Platform Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Cloud Platform Community Edition does not support the load balancing.</li><li>The **Alibaba Cloud SLB Service** in the **Manage Load Balancer** section applies only to the Apsara Stack environment. We recommend that you contact Technical Support for assistance.</li><li>If you deploy OBLB and OBProxy on the same host, access ports for OBLB must be different from SQL ports for OBProxy. Otherwise, applications cannot connect to the database. </li></ul></p></main> |
   | Access URL | The access URL of the OBProxy cluster. This parameter is displayed when **Manage Load Balancer** is disabled. In this case, you need to manually configure load balancing. The access URL is only used to generate a connection string for the tenant. If the access URL is a VIP, you must apply for the VIP and bind it to the OBProxy server.  |
   | Access Port Number | The access port number. The default port number is 2883. You must specify the actual port number based on the VIP. This parameter is displayed when **Manage Load Balancer** is disabled.  |
   | Startup Method | The startup method of the OBProxy cluster. Valid values: <ul><li> **ConfigUrl**: specifies the multicluster startup method, where the OBProxy cluster can access multiple OceanBase clusters.    </li><li> **RsList**: specifies the single cluster startup method. The OBProxy cluster can access only the OceanBase cluster specified when the OBProxy cluster is created. After an OBProxy cluster is created, no more connectable OceanBase clusters can be added. </li>    </ul> |
   | Select Accessible OceanBase Clusters | The OceanBase clusters that are accessible to the OBProxy cluster.  <ul><li> This parameter is optional if you set **Startup Method** to **ConfigUrl**. After you create an OceanBase cluster, you can select the cluster here. For more information, see [Add a connectable OceanBase cluster](300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/200.add-a-connectable-oceanbase-cluster.md).    </li><li> You must specify the value of this parameter when **Startup Method** is **RsList**.  Select the OceanBase cluster from the drop-down list.  </li><li> If the password box contains the credentials of the proxyro user of the cluster, the proxyro user is selected by default.    </li><li>Otherwise, click **Create Connection** to create a connection credential for the proxyro user of the cluster.  </li>    </ul> |

5. Optional. Specify fields in the **Deploy OBProxy** section.

   If you want to deploy the OBProxy when you create an OBProxy cluster, you can skip this step. After the cluster is created, you can add an OBProxy to the cluster by taking the following actions: [take over an OBProxy](400.manage-a-obproxy-server/200.take-over-an-obproxy.md) or [add an OBProxy](400.manage-a-obproxy-server/100.add-an-obproxy.md).

   1. Toggle on the switch in the upper-right corner of the **Deploy OBProxy** page.

   2. Refer to the following table to specify the parameters.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |---------------|--------------|
      | **IDC** | The IDC of the OBProxy. Each OBProxy can be deployed in only one IDC.  |
      | **Host Type** | Optional. If you select a host type, the host list is filtered based on the host type.  |
      | **Host** | Specify the host where the OBProxy is to be deployed. You can click **Add Host** in the drop-down list to add more hosts.  |

      ![08261945](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/420/%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2obproxy-2.png)

      By default, fields for two OBProxies are displayed.

      * To deploy more OBProxies, click **Add OBProxy** to add an OBProxy.

      * If you need to deploy only one OBProxy, click the Delete icon to the right of an OBProxy to delete it.

6. Enable **Parameter Settings** to add or modify startup parameters and other parameters. For more information, see [OBProxy parameters](../800.obproxy-functions/800.obproxy-parameters-description.md).

7. Enable **Custom Settings** to specify the cluster port number, OS user, and installation path.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |-----|-------|
   | **SQL Port Number** | The default port number is 2883. You can change the port number.  |
   | **Exporter Port Number** | The default port number is 2884. You can change the port number.  |
   | **OS User** | The OS user that you use to install and run OceanBase Database. You cannot edit this parameter here. To change the user, you can modify the default value of the `ocp.operation.default.os.user` parameter. For more information, see [Modify system parameters](../1600.system-management-features/500.manage-system-parameter/200.modify-system-parameters.md).  |
   | **Software Installation Path** | <ul><li> If the value of **OS User** is `admin`, that of **Software Installation Path** is `/home/admin/obproxy` by default. You can specify a custom path. </li><li>If the value of **OS User** is not `admin`, that of **Software Installation Path** is `/opt/oceanbase/obproxy` by default. You can specify a custom path. </li></ul>  Click **Test** to check whether the path can be used. If the path cannot be used, you can perform troubleshooting based on the test results, or use another path.  |

8. Click **Submit**.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>When OBProxy is installed, the system checks whether the permissions on the installation directory are correct. The system checks the read and execution permissions of a specified user (the admin user by default) on folders at each level of the <code>/home/admin/logs/obproxy</code> directory. If the user does not have the required permissions, the "check directory xxx permission failed, reason: xxx" error is generated in the log. </p>
