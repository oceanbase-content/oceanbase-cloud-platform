# Create an OBProxy cluster

You can create an OBProxy cluster by specifying its basic information, deployment mode, and advanced settings. Then, you can add OBProxies to the OBProxy cluster or connect the OBProxy cluster to an OceanBase cluster.

## Prerequisites

* You have the OBPROXY_MANAGER role or the permissions to manage OBProxies.
* If you want to configure an RPC port for an OBProxy, the OBProxy version must be V4.3.0 or later.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy** to go to the OBProxy page.

3. Click **Create OBProxy Cluster** in the upper-right corner. The **Create OBProxy Cluster** page appears.

4. Specify the parameters of the OBProxy cluster in the **Basic Information** section.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |------|------|
   | Cluster Name     | The name of the cluster. You can specify the cluster name based on your business requirements. The name must start with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_). |
   | root@proxysys Password  | The password of the root@proxysys account used to log on to the OBProxy cluster for managing proxy parameters. This password can be customized or randomly generated. The password must meet the following complexity requirements: <ul><li>It must be 8 to 32 characters in length. </li><li>It must contain characters of at least three of the following types: digits (0 to 9), uppercase letters (A to Z), lowercase letters (a to z), and special characters. Supported special characters are: <code>~ ! @ # % ^ & * _ - + = \| ( ) { } [ ] : ; , . ?/</code>.  </li></ul> |
   | Software Version  | The software version of OBProxy. <ul><li>If the required version exists in the drop-down list, select it directly.   </li><li>If the required version does not exist in the drop-down list, click **Add Version** at the bottom of the drop-down list to upload the required version. </li> </ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>You can select only an OBProxy software package of V1.8.0 or later. For security purposes, we recommend that you select an OBProxy software package of V3.1.0 or later.</p></main> |
   | Enter the password of the proxyro user  | The password of the proxyro account for OBProxy to access the OceanBase cluster. This parameter is displayed only when the software version of OBProxy is earlier than V4.0. If this parameter is not specified, the default password of the proxyro account is used. The password must meet the following requirements: <ul><li>It must be 8 to 32 characters in length. </li><li>It must contain characters of at least three of the following types: digits (0 to 9), uppercase letters (A to Z), lowercase letters (a to z), and special characters. </li><li>Supported special characters are: <code>~ ! @ # % ^ & * _ - + = \| ( ) { } [ ] : ; , . ? /</code>.  </li></ul> |
   | Manage Load Balancer  | After load balancing management is enabled, you can configure OceanBase Load Balancer (OBLB) to improve the load balancing capability of an OBProxy cluster. <ul><li>OBLB Service: You can select the OBLB service configured when OCP is deployed, or click **Add OBLB Service** and then add the OBLB service on the right-side pane. For more information, see the **Add a load balancer** section in [Manage load balancing](300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/300.manage-load-balancing.md). <ul><li>**OBLB Service Address**: the address of the OBLB service. </li><li>**OBLB Service Port**: the port of the OBLB service. The default service port is 9090. You can change the service port as needed. </li><li>**Username & Password**: the username and password of the OBLB service, which are used to get the authentication information about the OBLB interface. </li></ul></li><li>**VIP**: the virtual IP address of the OBLB service. </li><li>**Access Port Number**: The default access port number is 2883. You can change the access port. </li><li>**Domain Name Configuration (optional)**: the configuration that points to the virtual IP address (VIP) and port. OCP does not provide the mappings between VIPs and domain names. You must configure the domain name resolution service. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p><ul><li><b>Manage Load Balancer</b> applies only to OCP Enterprise Edition. </li><li>The <b>Alibaba Cloud SLB Service</b> in the <b>Manage Load Balancer</b> section applies only to the Apsara Stack environment. We recommend that you contact OCP Technical Support for assistance. </li><li>If you deploy OBLB and OBProxy on the same host, access ports for OBLB must be different from SQL ports for OBProxy. Otherwise, applications cannot connect to the database. </li></ul></p></main> |
   | Access URL       | The access URL of the OBProxy cluster. This parameter is displayed when **Manage Load Balancer** is disabled. In this case, you need to manually configure load balancing. The access URL is only used to generate a connection string for the tenant. If the access URL is a VIP, you must apply for the VIP and bind it to the OBProxy server.  |
   | Access Port Number       | The access port number. The default port number is 2883. You must specify the actual port number based on the VIP. This parameter is displayed when **Manage Load Balancer** is disabled.  |
   | Startup Method     |The startup method of the OBProxy cluster. Valid values: <ul><li>**ConfigUrl**: specifies the multi-cluster startup method, where the OBProxy cluster can access multiple OceanBase clusters.   </li><li>**RsList**: specifies the single-cluster startup method. The OBProxy cluster can access only the specified OceanBase cluster when the OBProxy cluster is created. After an OBProxy cluster is created, no more connectable OceanBase clusters can be added. </li>    </ul>    |
   | Select Accessible OceanBase Clusters | The OceanBase clusters that the OBProxy cluster can connect to. You can select only those on the same network as the OBProxy cluster. <ul><li>This parameter is optional if you set **Startup Method** to **ConfigUrl**. After you create an OceanBase cluster, you can select the cluster here. For more information, see [Add a connectable OceanBase cluster](300.manage-a-obproxy-cluster/200.add-a-connectable-oceanbase-cluster.md).   </li><li>This parameter is required if **Startup Method** is set to **RsList**. Select the OceanBase cluster from the drop-down list. </li><li>If the password box contains the credentials of the proxyro user of the cluster, the proxyro user is selected by default.   </li><li>Otherwise, click **Create Connection** to create a connection credential for the proxyro user of the cluster. </li> </ul>   |

5. (Optional) Specify the parameters in the **Deploy OBProxy** section.

   If you want to deploy an OBProxy when you create an OBProxy cluster, perform the following steps. Otherwise, you can skip this step, and then add an OBProxy to the cluster by taking the following actions after the cluster is created: [take over an OBProxy](400.manage-a-obproxy-server/200.take-over-an-obproxy.md) or [add an OBProxy](400.manage-a-obproxy-server/100.add-an-obproxy.md).

8. Click **Submit**.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>When OBProxy is installed, the system checks whether the permissions on the installation directory are correct. The system checks the read and execution permissions of a specified user (the admin user by default) on folders at each level of the <code>/home/admin/logs/obproxy</code> directory. If the user does not have the required permissions, the "check directory xxx permission failed, reason: xxx" error is generated in the log. </p>
