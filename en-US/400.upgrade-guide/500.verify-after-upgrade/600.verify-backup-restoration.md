# Verify the backup and restore feature

After upgrading OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you must log on to the OCP console to verify whether the backup and restore feature is working properly.

## Procedure

If the components of the backup and restore feature were configured in the source version of OCP, perform the following steps to verify whether this feature is working properly after the upgrade:

1. Verify whether the services can be operated properly: Perform maintenance operations such as starting and stopping nodes in the service to check whether they can be executed successfully.

2. Create a backup policy: Define a backup strategy based on the actual backup requirements.

3. Perform an immediate backup to check whether it can be executed successfully: It is recommended that you perform a major compaction before the backup considering that logical backup can only be performed once for each data version.

4. Verify whether backup tasks can be properly scheduled according to the backup policy: Adjust the backup schedule time to the most recent time and check whether the backup schedule can be executed successfully. It is recommended that you perform a major compaction before the backup schedule considering that logical backup can only be performed once for each data version.
