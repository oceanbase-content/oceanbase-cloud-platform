# Considerations

This topic introduces the considerations for upgrading OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

The upgrade process mainly involves upgrading and reconfiguring the **OCP-Agent**, **MetaDB**, **MonitorDB**, and **OCP-Server** in the [system architecture](../../200.product-introduction/200.product-architecture.md), as well as upgrading and reconfiguring the associated runtime modules, including the OceanBase Database Proxy (OBProxy) and ConfigURL service (which is a configuration service for the OceanBase cluster).

To avoid the risk of being unable to roll back in case of upgrade failure, we recommend that you back up the current OCP environment in advance, including software, logs, data, and configurations. If the upgrade fails, contact OCP Technical Support for assistance to ensure that you can roll back to the original version.

After the upgrade is completed, use your account and password before the upgrade to log in. If you have not changed the default account name and password, use them to log in.
