   >
   > **Note**

5. In the **Upgrade** dialog box, enter the required information.

   The following table describes the related fields.

   | **Field** | **Description** |
   |---------|------------|
   | Upgrade Mode | The upgrade method. At present, OAT only supports **Upgrade with Services Stopped**, which is suitable for products without business continuity requirements. In this upgrade mode, OAT stops the services of the old version of OCP, which cannot provide external services.  |
   | Select an image file for the upgrade | The image file of the target version.  |
   | Username | The username of OCP. This field is not displayed if the source version is OCP V4.0.1 or later.  |
   | Password | The password of OCP. This field is not displayed if the source version is OCP V4.0.1 or later.  |

8. Log on to the OCP console. If the page of OCP appears, the major components in the system architecture of OCP have been upgraded. Some time-consuming tasks continue to run in the background.

   You need to verify the upgrade from the following aspects:

   1. In the task list, check whether the task for upgrading OCP-Agent is properly running.

   2. Open the bootstrap.log file of OCP-Server, which is located in `/home/admin/logs/ocp` by default, and find the tasks marked as DELAYED, such as `ALTER_TABLES_DELAYED` and `MIGRATIONS_DELAYED`. Then, check whether the tasks are marked as END. The BEGIN and END marks appear in pairs.

   3. If the upgrade fails, open the ocp.log file of OCP-Server, which is located in `/home/admin/logs/ocp` by default, and check for unexpected errors in logs with the keyword "BootstrapRunListener" or "DataSourceInterceptor". Such logs are generated after ocp-bootstrap registers with a listener, which is used to block Spring bean initialization events. If an unexpected error is reported, contact OCP Technical Support.
