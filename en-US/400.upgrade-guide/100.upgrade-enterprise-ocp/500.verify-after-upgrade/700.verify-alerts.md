# Verify the alert feature

After upgrading OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you must log on to the OCP console to verify whether the alert feature is working properly.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console by using the admin account.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Monitoring and Alerts > Alerts**.

3. Check the alert feature.

   * On the **Alert Rules** tab, check for alert rules that are not enabled. You can enable an alert rule on the alert rule creation or editing page.
