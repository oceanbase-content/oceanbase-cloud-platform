    <ul>
    <li>Only OCP V3.3.0-BP1 and later can be upgraded by using a browser.</li>

## Upgrade OCP by using the CLI tool

### Prerequisites

* The OCP Docker container has been installed on the central control server.

* You have decompressed the `ocp-4.0.3-ce.tar.gz` software package to a directory on the central control server. For more information, see [Prepare for installation](../../300.deployment-guide/200.deploying-community-ocp/400.installation-preparation.md). The package contains the following files:

  * `ocp_installer.sh`: the OCP installation script.

  * `ocp.tar.gz`: the OCP image file.

  * `ocp-installer.tar.gz`: the OCP installer image file.

  * `config.yaml`: the OCP configuration file.

* You have modified the OCP configuration file based on your actual deployment environment.

### Procedure

1. Log on to the central control server as the root user and go to the directory where the `ocp_installer.sh` file is located.

2. Optional. Call the `ocp_installer.sh` file to view the OCP upgrade method.

   ```bash
   #./ocp_installer.sh help
   Usage:
   ./ocp_installer.sh COMMAND -c config_file -i installer_image_file [-o ocp_image_file] [-k ssh_key_file] [-v] [-h]
   Description:
   OCP installer
   Commands:
   install      install OCP
   uninstall    delete OCP and metadb(if configured)
   upgrade      upgrade OCP
   replace      replace OCP container, used for upgrade to the bp version, or just restart
   Options:
   -c           required, path to config file
   -i           installer image file
   -o           ocp image file
   -k           ssh_key_file
   -v           show verbose messages
   -h           show this help mesages
   ```

3. Run the following code to upgrade OCP.
   OCP supports full upgrade and container replacement upgrade.

   * The full upgrade mode is suitable for general OCP version upgrades.

      ```bash
      # Use password for Secure Shell (SSH) authentication.
      ./ocp_installer.sh upgrade -c config.yaml -i ./ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ./ocp.tar.gz
      # Use key for SSH authentication.
      ./ocp_installer.sh upgrade -c config.yaml -k /root/.ssh/id_rsa -i ./ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ./ocp.tar.gz
      ```

   * The container replacement upgrade mode is suitable for minor version upgrades, where the MetaDB is not updated.

      ```bash
      # Use password for SSH authentication.
      ./ocp_installer.sh replace -c config.yaml -i ./ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ./ocp.tar.gz
      # Use key for SSH authentication.
      ./ocp_installer.sh replace -c config.yaml -k /root/.ssh/id_rsa -i ./ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ./ocp.tar.gz
      ```

     -p           expose port of installer container
     -h           show this help mesages
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the ocp_installer:

   ```bash
   # To use the default parameters, run the following command. In this case, the image file in the current directory, id_rsa file of the current user, and Port 3000 are used.
   ./ocp_installer.sh launch
   # To use custom parameters, run the following command and specify the image file, key file, and port number.
   ./ocp_installer.sh launch -i ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ocp.tar.gz -k /root/.ssh/id_rsa -p 3000
   ```

4. Use the corresponding IP address and port in the `IP:port` format to access the deployment page in a browser. On the page that appears, click **Upgrade**.
