# ob_tenant_no_frozen

## Description

OceanBase Database V4.0 and later support minor compactions of a tenant. If a minor compaction is not performed for a tenant in the specified threshold period of time since the last minor compaction, this alert is triggered.

## Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Metric | no_frozen_seconds |
| Source | Internal views. SQL statements for metric collection: ```select tenant_id, time_to_usec(frozen_time) as frozen_time, time_to_usec(now()) as current from CDB_OB_MAJOR_COMPACTION``` |
| Collected metric | ob_compaction_current_timestamp,ob_compaction_frozen_time |
| Metric expression | (max(ob_compaction_current_timestamp{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS) - max(ob_compaction_frozen_time{@LABELS}) by (@GBLABELS)) / 1000000 |
| Collection cycle | 1 minute |

## Alert rule

| Metric expression | Metric description | Default threshold | Detection cycle | Time before clearance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| no_frozen_seconds > 90000 | The time elapsed since the last minor compaction of a tenant, in seconds. | 90000 (25 hours) | 60 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

| Trigger method | Alert level | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical | Tenant |

## Alert templates

* Alert overview: ${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
* Alert details: Cluster: ${ob_cluster_name}. Tenant: ${tenant_name}. Alert: ${alarm_name}
* Overview example: ob_cluster=C1-1000:tenant_name=T1. No minor compaction has been performed for the OceanBase Database tenant for a long time.
* Details example: Cluster: obcluster. Tenant: T1. Alert: No minor compaction has been performed for the OceanBase Database tenant for a long time.

## Impact on the system

If no major compaction or minor compaction is performed for the tenant for a long time, the disk usage increases, causing the disk space to be fully used and affecting writes of the application system.

## Possible causes

* The daily major compaction feature is disabled or the upgrade mode parameter is enabled.
* The RootService is suspended because the OBServer cluster is leaderless or the process is suspended due to an exception.

## Solutions

The solution is the same as that for the [ob_cluster_no_frozen](9.ob_cluster_no_frozen.md) alert.
