host_disk_readonly
=======================================

**Description**
------------------------------------

This alert is triggered when a disk is mounted to the `/` root directory as read-only.

Principle
------------------------------

The following table describes the key parameters that are involved in the monitoring and alerting logic.

| Metric            | disk_readonly_flag <blockquote>**Note** <br> Specifies whether the disk is mounted as read-only. When the value is 1, the disk is mounted as read-only. When the value is 0, the disk is mounted as read/write. This alert is triggered when the value is 1.</blockquote> |
| Source            | The metrics are collected from node_exporter. The records of the detection on read-only mounted disks are stored in `host.check.readonly.mountpoint`. By default, only disks in the `/` mount point are detected. Add the tag of check_readonly="1".                         |

**Alert information**
------------------------------------------

|            Trigger method             | Alert level | Scope  |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| Based on the expression of the metric | Critical    | Server |

**Alert templates**
----------------------------------------

* Overview: ${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}

* Details: Cluster: ${ob_cluster_name}, Host: ${host}, Alert: ${alarm_name}, The disk mount point ${mount_point} is read-only.

* Overview example: svr_ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Read-only server disk

* Details example: Cluster: obcluster-1, Host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, Alert: Read-only server disk, The disk mount point /data/t is read-only.

**Impact on the system**
---------------------------------------------

This alert is for read-only detection on disks mounted to the / directory. When the disk is mounted to the / directory as read-only, most processes cannot properly work. For example, logs cannot be recorded and configurations cannot be updated. This can lead to serious system errors.

**Possible causes**
----------------------------------------

* The disk is mounted as read-only.

* An error occurs in the file system.

* The disk has a bad sector.

**Suggested solutions**
--------------------------------------------

1. Run the following commands to verify the alert.

   1. Run the `$mount | grep '(ro,'` command to view the disk that is mounted as read-only.

   2. Run the `df -h` command to check whether the disk is mounted to the root directory.

2. Contact the disk manufacturer to repair or replace the disk.
