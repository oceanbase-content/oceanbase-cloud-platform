# os_tsar_cpu_util_hwm

## Description

This alert is triggered when CPU utilization (util + steal) exceeds 90%. 

## Principle

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Metric | cpu_used_percent, cpu_steal |
| Source | This metric is a basic host monitoring metric collected by node_exporter. </br>The metric is equivalent to CPU utilization (util = user + system + nice + irq + softirq) in the top command output. |
| Collected metric | node_cpu_seconds_total |
| Metric expression | <li>cpu_used_percent: 100 * (1 - sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=~"idle&#124;iowait",@LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS))</li><li>cpu_steal: 100 * sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="steal", @LABELS}[@INTERVAL])) by (@GBLABELS)</li> |
| Collection cycle | 1 second |

## Alert rule

| Metric expression | Metric description | Default threshold (unit: percentage) | Detection cycle | Elimination cycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cpu_used_percent > 90 and cpu_steal < 20 | CPU steal: the percentage of time when a virtual machine is waiting on the physical CPU for its CPU time. The percentage can be higher than the limit. </br>CPU utilization (util), consisting of the following:<li>user: the percentage of CPU time spent running user-mode code.</li><li>system: the percentage of CPU time spent running kernel-mode code.</li><li>nice: the percentage of CPU time spent changing process priority. The default value is 0.</li><li>irq: the percentage of CPU time spent handling hardware interrupts.</li><li>softirq: the percentage of CPU time spent handling software interrupts.</li> | <li>cpu_used_percent: 90%</li><li>cpu_steal: 20%</li> | 10 seconds | 5 minutes |

## Alert information

## Alert templates

* Overview
   * Template: \${alarm_target} ${alarm_name}
   * Example: svr_ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx os_tsar_cpu_util_hwm
* Details
   * Template: Cluster: \${ob_cluster_name}, host: \${svr_ip}, alert: \${alarm_name}, CPU utilization \${cpu_used_percent_value_zh_cn} exceeds \${cpu_used_percent_alarm_threshold}%, percentage of CPU steal time \${cpu_steal_value_zh_cn} is lower than \${cpu_steal_alarm_threshold}%. 
   * Example: Cluster: obcluster, host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, alert: os_tsar_cpu_util_hwm, CPU utilization 90.186% exceeds 90%, percentage of CPU steal time 0% is lower than 20%. 

## Impact on the system

Longtime full CPU utilization will cause serious impact on system stability, or even cause the system to stop running. 

## Possible causes

* The percentage of CPU time spent running user-mode code is high. This is generally because too many application processes exist. For example, a large number of concurrent requests are sent or a large amount of data is processed. 
* The percentage of CPU time spent running kernel-mode code is high. For example, a large number system calls are initiated. 
* The percentage of CPU time spent handling software interrupts is high. For example, network attacks occur. 

## Suggested solutions

1. Run the `top` command to check which CPU utilization metric is high. 
2. If OBServer CPU utilization is high, check whether CPU-consuming operations such as major or minor compactions are performed. If CPU utilization is not as expected, contact the administrator.
