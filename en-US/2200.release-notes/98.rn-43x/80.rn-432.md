* The cluster takeover capability is improved to ensure that the config server can still provide external services during a takeover.
* The GUI of OCP is available (read-only) during an OCP upgrade.
* Parameter configuration management is supported for OCP Agent. Monitoring data collection can be dynamically controlled. This can reduce the pressure of the sys tenant when a large amount of data is to be collected in the case of exceptions.
* OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Open Authorization 2.0 (OAuth 2.0) are supported for single sign-on (SSO), addressing user-side configuration issues.

## Product optimizations

### Cluster management

* You can select a load type for a cluster of OceanBase Database V4.3.0 or later during cluster creation. The default load type is hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP).
* You can specify the upgrade sequence of zones in a cluster to manually control the leader switching time, thereby minimizing the impact of leader switching on business.
* By default, the parameter settings of an existing OBServer node in the cluster are used for the new OBServer node by default.
* The credential export process during cluster move-out is optimized to reduce risks.

### Tenant management

* When you create a tenant in a cluster of OceanBase Database V4.3.0 or later, you can select a load type for the tenant, to improve the performance in online transaction processing (OLTP), online analytical processing (OLAP), HTAP, and OBKV business scenarios.
* A confirmation prompt is provided for tenant-level changes, to avoid exceptions caused by misoperations.
* You can view the resource usage limits for a tenant under the current resource specifications, such as the number of log streams and tablets.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    You can view the resource usage limits for a tenant only if the cluster to which the tenant belongs meets the following version requirements:
    <ul><li>OceanBase Database V4.2.x: V4.2.4 or later</li><li>OceanBase Database V4.3.x: V4.3.1 or later</li></ul>
    </main>

* You can create and view database users with the hostname syntax in MySQL tenants.
* You can query sessions by session ID.

### Other optimizations

* **OBProxy**: You can copy the name of an OBProxy cluster.

* **Binlog service**: The binlog instance list can display standby instances, and allows you to restart and stop standby instances.

* **Task management**: The task node skip feature is optimized to avoid affecting the status of database objects.

* **Host management**: OCP V4.3.2 adds the following host standardization check items: Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size, Network Time Protocol (NTP), as well as kernel parameters `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range` and `net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports`.

## Product behavioral changes

**Backup and restore**: The step of installing the logical backup and restore service is removed from the installation wizard.

## Key features

### Tenant cloning

OceanBase Database tenants are similar to conventional database instances. OceanBase Database supports two types of tenants: MySQL tenants and Oracle tenants. With the tenant cloning feature, you can quickly copy the metadata of a source tenant to a new tenant (clone tenant). In the initial status, the two tenants share the same physical macroblocks. The new tenant and source tenant are independent of each other. Data and resources are isolated between the two tenants. Data changes in either tenant do not affect the other tenant.

It takes only 2 minutes to clone a source tenant with eight CPU cores, 64 GiB of memory, and 1 TiB data in a test environment. OCP also supports synchronizing source tenant parameters and performing resource checks to facilitate tenant cloning. This feature applies to business scenarios such as report tasks, application version releases, database changes, and data export, and can improve the task execution efficiency and reduce business risks in such scenarios.

### CPU core binding configuration

CPU core binding (taskset) is a technology that binds a specific process or thread to a specific CPU core. This way, key tasks are processed by fixed CPU cores, instead of being frequently switched from one core to another. CPU core binding reduces the context switching overhead and improves the overall system performance. You can enable or disable CPU core binding for OBProxy clusters and OceanBase clusters. According to onsite test data, CPU core binding can reduce the response time by 15% to 20% in a scenario where the OBProxy and OceanBase Database are deployed on the same ARM-based server.

However, excessive use of the technology may lead to a situation where some CPU cores are overloaded while others are idle, decreasing resource utilization in the system. You need to decide whether to use CPU core binding and adjust the core binding strategy based on your business conditions to achieve the optimal performance and resource utilization.

## Bug fixes

The following issues are fixed in OCP V4.3.2:

* Fixed the issue of incompatibility when you deploy two clusters with the same name in OCP.
* Fixed the issue where the connectable OceanBase clusters of an OBProxy started by using the RootService list cannot be taken over.
* Fixed the issue of tenant traffic monitoring exceptions during node replacement.
* Fixed the issue where a failover between the primary and standby OCP clusters fails in multi-cluster mode.
* Fixed the issue where querying top SQL statements based on parameters provided in the official site fails.
* Fixed the issue where the button for sorting clusters is invalid on the homepage of OceanBase Autonomy Service.
