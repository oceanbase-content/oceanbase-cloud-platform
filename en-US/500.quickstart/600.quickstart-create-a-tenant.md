# Create a tenant

A tenant can be seen as a container for database objects and resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O resources. You can create tenants in a cluster as needed.

in the following ways:

* Create a tenant on the Tenant Overview page.

* Create a tenant on the Tenant Management page of the specified cluster.

This topic describes how to create a tenant on the Tenant Management page of the specified cluster.

## Prerequisites

* The cluster where you want to create the tenant is the running primary cluster.

* You are logged on with an account that has the permission to manage the cluster. For example, the user is the system administrator or the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) tenant administrator.

* (Optional) You have created a parameter template by referring to [Manage tenant parameter templates](../600.cluster-functions/1200.cluster-parameters-template-management.md).

   When you need to create multiple tenants with the same parameter configuration, you can use a parameter template to avoid repeatedly configuring the same parameters.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Tenant Management**.

5. In the upper-right corner of the page that appears, click **Create Tenant**.

6. Specify the parameters in the **Basic Information** section.

   1. The cluster is specified to the current cluster by default.

   2. Enter the tenant name in **Tenant Name**. The tenant name must be 2 to 64 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_).

7. Specify the parameters in the **Zone Information** section.

   1. Configure the replica type, unit specification, and unit quantity for z1, z2, and z3.

      After you select a cluster, the page provides a list of supported zones based on the zone information of the selected cluster. You can select zones for which the replica locality does not need to be specified and click the Delete button on the right to delete them.
      * Select a replica type from the drop-down list. Full-featured, read-only, and log replicas are supported.

      * You can use the built-in unit specifications or click Add Specification at the bottom of the drop-down list to add a custom specification.

      * Specify the number of units in the zone. Note that the number of units cannot exceed the number of servers in the zone.

      <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>We recommend that you set the same specifications and number of units for full-featured replicas. Different specifications or numbers of units can affect performance or stability.</p>

   2. Specify the **priorities of zones**. If you drag multiple zones to the right-side pane at a time, these zones have the same priority.

8. Specify the parameters in the **Basic Information** section. The required fields and their descriptions are listed in the following table.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |---------------|---|
   | **Cluster** | The cluster to which the tenant belongs. The default value is the current cluster. <blockquote>**Note** </br>When you create a tenant on the Tenant Overview page, you must specify the cluster of the tenant. </blockquote> |
   | **Tenant Mode** | Valid values: MySQL and Oracle. <blockquote>**Notice**</br>The Oracle mode is supported only for OceanBase Database V2.1 and later. </blockquote> |
   | **Tenant Name** | The tenant name must be 2 to 64 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_).  |
   | **Administrator Password** | The password of the tenant administrator account, which can be randomly generated.  <ul><li> The administrator account is root in MySQL mode.    </li><li> The administrator account is SYS in Oracle mode. </li> </ul>   The password must meet the following requirements:<ul><li>The length is 8 to 32 characters.</li><li>It contains at least three of the following character types: digits(0\~9), uppercase letters(A\~Z), lowercase letters(a\~z), and special characters (ie: <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=\|(){}[]:;,.?/</code>). </li> </ul> |
   | **Character Set and Encoding** | <ul><li> In MySQL mode, the supported character sets are UTF8MB4, Binary, GBK, and GB18030. Default value: UTF8MB4.    </li><li> In Oracle mode, the supported character sets are UTF8MB4, GBK, and GB18030. Default value: UTF8MB4.  </li> </ul> |
   | **Collation** | The detailed collation corresponding to the specified character set.  |
   | **Remarks** | This field is optional and allows you to add additional information.  |

9. Specify the parameters in the **Replica Settings** section.

   * If the version of the specified cluster is V4.0 or later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones, which is 1 by default.

      ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE3.png)

   * If the version of the specified cluster is earlier than V4.0, you can set different numbers of units for different zones.

      ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE4.png)

   By default, the system displays configurable zones based on the zone information of the selected cluster. If you do not need to create a replica in a zone, click the Delete icon to delete the zone. The zone information fields that need to be configured and their descriptions are listed in the following table.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |----------------|------|
   | **Replica Type** | The type of the replica. Valid values: <ul><li>Full-featured replicas</li><li> Read-only replicas   </li><li> Log-only replicas</li></ul>    Select multiple full-featured replicas to ensure that they are in the majority.  |
   | **Unit Specification** | OCP has a set of built-in unit specifications. You can select the specification that you need from the list of unit specifications or click [Add Specification](../700.tenant-functions/500.ocp-resource-unit-specifications.md) at the bottom of the list to add a custom specification. For more information, see **OCP resource unit specifications**.  |
   | **Units** | The number of units in the zone. The number of resource units cannot exceed the number of OBServers in the zone.  |
   | **Zone Priority Rankings** | The priorities of the zones. This priority order affects the priority order of the Primary Zone of the sys tenant.  The left-side list shows all zones in the cluster.  You can select one or more zones from the list box on the left to add them to the list box on the right. By default, the priority of a zone selected earlier is higher than that of a zone selected later, and the zones selected at one time have the same priority.  After you move the zones to the box on the right side, you can also drag them upward or downward to adjust their priority order. A zone takes priority over those beneath it.  |

10. Specify the parameters in the **Security Settings** section.

     * Access from all IP addresses is supported: This tenant can be accessed by any IP address.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>

    </main>

     * Custom: You can add allowed clients into the whitelist in the formats described in the following table. Example:

      | Format | Examples |
