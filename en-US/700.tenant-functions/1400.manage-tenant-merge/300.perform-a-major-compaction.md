# Perform a major compaction

You can immediately initiate a major compaction for an idle tenant. When an error occurs during the major compaction of the tenant, you can perform troubleshooting, clear the error, and then continue the major compaction.

## Prerequisites

You can initiate a major compaction only for a primary tenant. The major compaction for a standby tenant is automatically triggered after the standby tenant synchronizes the major compaction status of the primary tenant. You cannot manually initiate a major compaction for a standby tenant.

## Initiate a major compaction

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**.

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the target tenant and click its name.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management**.

5. In the **Basic Information** section of the **Details of Major Compaction** tab, make sure that **Status** is **Tenant idle**, and then click **Initiate Major Compaction**.

6. After a major compaction is initiated, the major compaction progress is displayed next to **Status**.

## Continue the major compaction

When an error occurs during the major compaction of the tenant, perform troubleshooting and then click **Clear Exceptions** to clear the error flag and continue the major compaction.
