# Details of tenant major compaction

A major compaction merges all dynamic and static data, which is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated in minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, OceanBase Database performs a major compaction on data of the same major version. You can view the information about the major compaction of a tenant on the **Details of Major Compaction** tab.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**.
   The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the target tenant and click its name.

4. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Compaction Management**.

5. In the **Last Major Compaction** section on the **Details of Major Compaction** tab, view the basic information about the last major compaction.

   The **Basic Information** section displays the tenant status, and the start and end time of the last major compaction.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>In the progress of a major compaction, the <strong>Start Time of Last Major Compaction</strong> field shows the start time of the ongoing major compaction. After the major compaction is completed, the <strong>End Time of Last Major Compaction</strong> field automatically displays the end time of the major compaction.</p>
    </main>

6. View details of a major compaction and a minor compaction.

   * The **Merge progress** section shows the information about the last major compaction of the tenant. If a major compaction is in progress, the information about the ongoing major compaction is displayed. If no major compaction is in progress, the details of the last major compaction version are displayed. The progress bar shows the major compaction status of the tenant. The statuses include **Error**, **In Major Compaction**, and **Completed**.
      You can hover the pointer over the time consumed by the major compaction to view the start time, end time, time consumed, and status of the major compaction.

   * The **Dump history** section shows the time and duration of the last minor compaction of the tenant.
      You can hover the pointer over the time consumed by the minor compaction to view the start time, end time, time consumed, data volume, and total rows processed of the minor compaction.

7. View the MemStore consumption of the tenant.

   You can perform the following operations to view and analyze the MemStore consumption data in the trend chart:

   * To view the trend details over a specific period of time, drag the pointer over the period of time to select this period. The system will then zoom in to display the trend details. After you view the trend details, double-click the trend chart to return to normal.
   * To hide the data of a tenant, click the icon of the tenant. The icon of the tenant will then turn gray and the data of the tenant will be hidden from the chart.
   * To view data at a specific point in time, hover the pointer over this point in time on the trend chart.
