# Manage users in a MySQL tenant

The user management feature allows you to view users under the current MySQL tenant, create a user, delete a user, and grant and revoke user privileges.

## Prerequisites

* You must have the permissions to modify the tenant.
* Only a primary tenant has the user management permissions.
* You cannot manage users with access restrictions on IP addresses, such as a user with the restriction of `testuser@10.%`.

## Procedure

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the Tenants page.

2. In the tenant list, find the target tenant and click its name to go to its **Overview** page.

3. In the left-side navigation pane, click **User Management** to go to the User Management page.

4. In the user list, view the following user parameters: **Username, Accessible Database, Login Connection String, Lock**, and **Actions**.

   1. You can lock a user to prevent the user from logging on to the database.

   2. You can perform various operations on users, such as lock a user, change the password of a user, modify the privileges of a user, and delete a user.

   3. You can view and copy the logon connection string.
