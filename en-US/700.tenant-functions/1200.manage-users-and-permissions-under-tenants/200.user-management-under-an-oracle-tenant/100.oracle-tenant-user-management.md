# User overview under an Oracle tenant

The user management feature allows you to view the users and roles under the current Oracle tenant.

## Users list

A user is a name defined in the database for connecting to and accessing objects. The list on the **Users** tab contains the following columns: **Username, System Permissions, Roles, Created At** , **Connection String Logon , Locked** , and **Actions** . The **Actions** column provides options for you to delete the user and change the password.
