   On this page, you can perform the following operations:
   * Modify the system privileges of the user: Click **Modify System Privileges**. In the dialog box that appears, select privileges from the drop-down list or remove existing privileges.

   * Change the user role: Click **Change Role**. In the dialog box that appears, select roles from the drop-down list.

   * Add objects that are accessible to the user: Click **Add Objects**. In the dialog box that appears, specify parameters described in the following table.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Object Type | Available options: **Table**, **View**, and **Stored Procedure**.  Note that you can add only one type of objects at a time. To add different types of objects, you need to add them separately.  |
      | Object | Select objects of other users so that you can access these objects. You can paste one or more objects into the field in the format of `username.object name`, such as `schemaname.tablename`. Separate objects with commas (,). <br>When you select objects, the access objects that have been added are filtered out. You can select only those that have not been added.  |
      | Grant Permission | Select the privileges to be granted as needed. For more information, see [System privileges](../300.system-privileges-in-a-mysql-tenant.md).  |

      After the accessible objects are added, the user can access and perform operations on these objects within the granted privileges.

   * Delete objects:

      * Delete an object: In the **Accessible Objects** list, locate the row that contains the target object, and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.

      * Batch delete objects: In the **Accessible Objects** list, select the target objects, and click the **Batch Delete** button.

      After an accessible object is deleted, the user can no longer access the object.

   * Modify object privileges:

      * Modify the privileges on an object: In the **Accessible Objects** list, locate the row that contains the target object, and click **Modify Privilege** in the **Actions** column.

      * Batch modify privileges on objects: In the **Accessible Objects** list, select the target objects, and click the **Batch Modify Privileges** button.
