# Edit a tenant replica in a zone

This topic describes how to edit a tenant replica in a zone.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Modifying the unit specifications triggers partition replica migration, and increases the storage I/O of OBServer nodes and the network traffic between OBServer nodes. To control traffic surges, we recommend that you change the values of the <code>ha_high_thread_score</code> and <code>ha_mid_thread_score</code> parameters, or perform resource isolation for <code>HA_HIGH</code> and <code>HA_MID</code> backend tasks. </p>

## Prerequisites

* A cluster of OceanBase Database V4.0.0 or later but earlier than V4.2.0 supports only **full-featured replicas** and does not support reducing the number of units for zones.
* If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.2.0 or later, **full-featured** and **read-only replicas** are supported.
* If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0.0 or later, the unit specifications are limited by default. If you want to use specifications lower than the default specifications, you can modify the <code>__min_full_resource_pool_memory</code> parameter to adjust the minimum values for the unit specifications. For example, if your cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.1.0, you can modify the parameter by referring to the  <a href="https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000001697240">Modify cluster parameters</a> topic.
* If the version of the cluster of a user tenant is OceanBase Database V4.2.0 or later and the tenant parameter <code>enable_rebalance</code> is set to <code>false</code>, you cannot change the number of units for zones.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** tab automatically appears.

3. On the **Tenants** tab, find the target tenant and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

4. In the **Replica Details** section, you can perform different operations based on the OceanBase cluster version.

   * In a **standalone centralized** database, you can modify only the unit specifications for a tenant.

   * For a tenant in a **distributed cluster**:

      * If the cluster version is earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0.0, you can click **Edit** in the **Actions** column to modify the replica type, unit specifications, and number of units for zones.

      * If the cluster version is V4.0.0 or later, you cannot separately change the number of units for a single zone. You can click **Modify Unit** in the upper-right corner to modify the number of units and unit specifications for all zones in the tenant. You can also click **Edit** in the **Actions** column to modify the replica type and unit specifications for a single zone.
