<h4>Note</h4><p>
When the tenant is in a primary/standby relationship:
<ul><li>If you modify the tenant configurations, the modification may affect the synchronization efficiency between the primary and standby tenants and the tenant performance. In this case, we recommend that you configure the same settings for the primary and standby tenants. </li>
<li>If <b>network-based synchronization</b> is used between the primary and standby tenants and archiving is not enabled for the primary tenant, REDO logs of the primary tenant may be overwritten before being synchronized to the standby tenant. In this case, we recommend that you enable log archiving for the primary tenant. </li></ul>
