# Clone a tenant

This topic describes how to clone a tenant. You can create a tenant by cloning a specified tenant. The number of units and unit distribution on OBServer nodes are the same for the new tenant and the source tenant.

## Prerequisites

* You must enable log archiving for the source tenant.
* The source tenant must be running properly or locked.
* You can clone only the configurations of the source tenant. The service name and tags of the source tenant cannot be cloned.
* You can clone only a primary tenant that belongs to an OceanBase cluster V4.3.0 or later.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click **Clone** in the **Actions** column.

4. In the dialog box that appears, specify the information of the new tenant.

    * **Tenant Name**: the name of the new tenant. It must start with a letter and end with a letter or a digit. It can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_), and must be 2 to 32 characters in length.
    * **Clone Tenant Parameters**: specifies whether to clone the parameter settings of the source tenant. By default, this option is enabled.
    * **Replica Details**: the unit specifications of the new tenant. The unit specifications affect the cloning speed. By default, high unit specifications of the source tenant are selected. The same unit specifications are used for all zones.
    * **Allowlist**: By default, the allowlist of the new tenant is the same as that of the source tenant. After the tenant is cloned, you can modify the allowlist on the tenant overview page.

5. Click **OK**.
