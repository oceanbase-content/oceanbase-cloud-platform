# Rename a tenant

This topic describes how to rename a tenant.

## Prerequisites

* In OceanBase Database V2.x or V3.x, you cannot rename a tenant in a standby cluster.

* You cannot rename the sys tenant.

## Considerations

Take note of the following considerations:

<li>After the tenant is renamed, you need to update the database connection string. </li>
<li>If the tenant is in a primary/standby relationship, the connection may be interrupted for a short period of time. </li>
<li>You need to search for historical alerts by the original tenant name. </li>
<li>The historical alert data may be incomplete. </li>

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

4. Click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and select **Rename** from the menu.

5. In the dialog box that appears, enter the new tenant name. For more information about the tenant naming conventions, see [Create a tenant](../300.create-a-tenant.md).
