# View the topology of a tenant

After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, you can perform the following operations to view the detailed topology of a tenant: Click Tenants in the left-side navigation pane. In the **Tenants** list, select the target tenant to go to its **Overview** page. On the left side of the page, click the topology to go to the **Tenant Topology** tab.

The topology shows the distribution of tenant replicas in the cluster. In the upper-right corner of the page, you can resize and refresh the topology.

The topology consists of four layers:

* The first layer indicates the cluster.

* The second layer indicates the zones.

* The third layer indicates the OBServer nodes.
