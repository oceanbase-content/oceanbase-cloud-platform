# Delete a tenant

This topic describes how to delete a tenant. When you delete a tenant from an OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster, the resource pools and data of the tenant are also deleted. A deleted tenant cannot enter the recycle bin, and the data of a deleted tenant cannot be recovered. Proceed with caution.

## Background information

You can delete only tenants of the primary cluster.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the target tenant and click its name to go to its details page.

4. Click **Delete Tenant** in the upper-right corner of the page.
