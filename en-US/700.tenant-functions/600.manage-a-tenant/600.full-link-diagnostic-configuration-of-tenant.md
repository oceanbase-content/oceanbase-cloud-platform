# Configure end-to-end diagnostics for a tenant

This topic describes how to enable and disable end-to-end diagnostics for a tenant, and how to use the feature.

## Prerequisites

End-to-end diagnostic parameters have been enabled. For more information, see [Configure trace query parameters](../../1300.log-service/300.configuration-trace-paremeters.md).

## Background information

After you enable end-to-end diagnostics, you can perform the following operations:

* Choose **Log Service** > **Trace Query** and view the trace diagnostic results of abnormal SQL statements. For more information, see [Trace query](../../1300.log-service/400.trace-query.md).
* Choose **SQL Diagnostics** > **SlowSQL** > **SQL Sampling** and view traces. For more information, see [Slow SQL diagnostics](../../1000.diagnosis-and-tuning-fuctions/100.manage-sql-diagnosis/600.slowsql-diagnostics.md).

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) V4.2.1 allows you to configure end-to-end diagnostics at the tenant and session levels. You can enable or disable this feature for specified objects as needed.

  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>Under the default end-to-end diagnostic configurations, the performance metrics of OceanBase Database can decrease by about 2%. We recommend that you disable this feature in performance-sensitive scenarios. </p>

## Configure end-to-end diagnostics for a tenant

You can enable or disable end-to-end diagnostics for a tenant on its Overview page.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <ul><li>You cannot enable end-to-end diagnostics for a business tenant that is in the Locked state. However, this limitation does not apply to the sys tenant. </li><li>You can still lock a business tenant for which the end-to-end diagnostics feature is enabled at the tenant or session level. After the business tenant is locked, the end-to-end diagnostics feature is disabled by default. </li><li>You can still delete a business tenant for which the end-to-end diagnostics feature is enabled at the tenant or session level. </li><li>If you disable end-to-end diagnostics for a tenant, this feature is disabled for all sessions in the tenant. </li><li>Changes in end-to-end diagnostic configurations of a tenant apply to all sessions in this tenant. </li></ul>
</main>

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the **Tenants** page.

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the target tenant and click its name to go to the Tenant Details page.

4. In the upper-right corner, click **End-to-End Diagnostics Settings**.

5. Configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |-----|------|
   | Trace Level | The supported trace levels are Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 1 indicates the module level and Level 3 is the most refined.  |
   | Sampling Ratio | Value range: 0 to 100%. Default value: 10%.  |
   | Sampled Content | <ul><li>ALL: All sampled traces are recorded in the log file. </li><li>ONLY_SLOW_QUERY: All sampled traces that belong to slow queries are recorded in the log file, and other traces are discarded. In this strategy, the server identifies slow queries based on the default threshold. </li><li>SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY: All traces of slow queries are recorded in the log file and sampling logs are recorded at a frequency of 0.01%. Force flush must be enabled. </li></ul> |
   | Enable | By default, end-to-end diagnostic configurations are enabled. If end-to-end diagnostic configurations are disabled, the end-to-end diagnostics feature is disabled.  |

## Configure end-to-end diagnostics for a session

You can enable or disable end-to-end diagnostics for a session on the Session Management page.
