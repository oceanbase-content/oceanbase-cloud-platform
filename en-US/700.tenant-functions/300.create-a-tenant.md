# Create a primary tenant

A tenant can be seen as a container for database objects and resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O resources. You can create a primary tenant in a cluster based on business needs.

You can create a primary tenant in the following ways in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console:

* Create a primary tenant on the Tenants page.

* Create a primary tenant on the Tenant Management page of a specified cluster.

This topic describes how to create a primary tenant on the Tenants page.

## Prerequisites

* The cluster where you want to create a tenant is the running primary cluster.

* You have logged on with an account that has the permissions to manage the cluster. For example, you act as the system administrator or the OCP tenant administrator.

* Optional. You have created a parameter template by referring to [Manage tenant parameter templates](1500.manage-tenant-parameter-templates.md).

   When you need to create multiple tenants with the same parameter configuration, you can use a parameter template to avoid repeatedly configuring the same parameters.

* The following conditions are met before you enable the arbitration service for a tenant:

  * The arbitration service is added for the cluster to which the tenant belongs, and the service is in the **RUNNING** state.

  * The locality of the tenant includes two or four full-featured replicas.

  * The resources available on the server hosting the arbitration service meet the resource requirements.

      You can modify the resource requirements by using the following system parameters based on your business requirements. For more information, see [Modify system parameters](1600.manage-tenant-parameters/200.modify-a-tenant-parameter.md).

    * `ocp.arbitration.min.remain.disk.size`: the minimum size in MB of the clog disk on the arbitration service host required when the arbitration service is enabled for the tenant. The parameter value is in the (a,b) format, indicating the minimum clog disk sizes required when the tenant has two and four full-featured replicas, respectively. Default value: `[12,24]`.
    * `ocp.arbitration.max.cpu.used.percentage`: the maximum CPU utilization in percentage (%) allowed on the arbitration service host when the arbitration service is enabled for the tenant. Default value: `90`.
    * `ocp.arbitration.max.memory.used.percentage`: the maximum memory usage in percentage (%) allowed on the arbitration service host when the arbitration service is enabled for the tenant. Default value: `90`.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page appears.

3. Click **Create Tenant** in the upper-right corner.

5. Configure the parameters in the **Replica Settings** section.

   By default, the system displays configurable zones based on the zone information of the selected cluster. If you do not need to create a replica in a zone, click the Delete icon to delete the zone. The zone information parameters that need to be configured and their descriptions are listed in the following table.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |----------------|------|
   | **Replica Type** | The type of the replica. Valid values: <ul><li>Full-featured Replica</li><li> Read-only Replica   </li><li> Log Replica</li></ul>    Select multiple full-featured replicas to ensure that they are in the majority.  <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In a **standalone centralized** database, only **full-featured replicas** are supported. </p></main> |
   | **Unit Specification** | OCP has a set of built-in unit specifications. You can select the specifications that you need from the list of unit specifications or click [Add Specification](500.ocp-resource-unit-specifications.md) at the bottom of the list to add custom specifications. For more information, see **OCP resource unit specifications**. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p><ul><li>We recommend that you set the same specifications and number of units for full-featured replicas. Different specifications or numbers of units can affect performance or stability. </li><li>If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V4.0.0 or later, take note of the following considerations:<ul><li>You cannot configure less than one CPU core for the tenant. </li><li>By default, the cluster limits the minimum memory size. You can adjust the limit by modifying the <code>__min_full_resource_pool_memory</code> parameter. For example, if the version is V4.1.0, you can modify the parameter by referring to <a href="https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000001697240">Modify cluster parameters</a>. </li></ul></p></main> |
   | **Units** | The number of units in the zone. The number of resource units cannot exceed the number of OBServer nodes in the zone. <ul><li>If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones, which is 1 by default. </li><li>If the cluster version is earlier than OceanBase Database V4.0, you can set different numbers of units for different zones. </li><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In a **standalone centralized** database, the default number of units is **1**, which cannot be modified. </p></main> |
   | **Zone Priority Rankings** | Specifies whether to define priorities for the zones of the tenant. The priorities affect the priority of the primary zone of the sys tenant. <ul><li>If this parameter is not specified, the zone priorities of the sys tenant are used by default. </li><li>If **Zone Priority Rankings** is enabled while no zone priorities, the random priority is used. </li> <li>To configure zone priorities, you can select one or more zones from the list on the left that displays all zones in the current cluster and add the selected zones to the list on the right. By default, the priority of a zone added earlier is higher than that of a zone added later, and the zones added at the same time have the same priority.  After you move the zones to the box on the right side, you can also drag them upward or downward to adjust their priority order. A zone takes priority over those beneath it. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>In a **standalone centralized** database, the zone priority rankings are not displayed, and Zone1 has the highest priority. </p></main> |
