# View the topology of a tenant

After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, you can perform the following operations to view the detailed topology of a tenant: Click Tenants in the left-side navigation pane. In the **Tenants** list, select the target tenant to go to its **Overview** page. On the left side of the page, click the topology to go to the **Tenant Topology** tab.

The topology shows the distribution of tenant replicas in the cluster. In the upper-right corner of the page, you can resize and refresh the topology.

The topology consists of four layers:

* The first layer indicates the cluster.

* The second layer indicates the tenant arbitration service.

* The third layer indicates the zones.

* The fourth layer indicates the OBServer nodes.

## Cluster

The cluster icon displays the name and status of the cluster to which the tenant belongs.

Click the More icon on the right of the cluster icon to view supported operations.

## Tenant arbitration service

The endpoint and status of the tenant arbitration service are displayed next to the cluster arbitration service icon.

Hover the pointer over the tenant arbitration service icon to view the detailed endpoint of the service and whether the service is enabled for the tenant.

## Zone

The name and status of the zone are displayed next to the zone icon.

If a zone contains a tenant replica, the zone icon is displayed in purple with the initial of the replica type next to the tenant name. Otherwise, the zone icon is gray.

* Zones with replicas

  * When you hover the pointer over a zone icon, a tooltip appears and displays the type of the replica and the number of units in the zone.

         <p>If the OceanBase Database version of the cluster is V4.0.0 or later, take note of the following considerations:<ul><li>You cannot configure less than one CPU core for the tenant. </li><li>By default, the cluster limits the minimum memory size. You can adjust the limit by modifying the <code>__min_full_resource_pool_memory</code> parameter. For example, if the version is V4.1.0, you can modify the parameter by referring to <a href="https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000001697240">Modify cluster parameters</a>.</p>
