# View the topology of a tenant

Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click its name. The **Overview** page of the tenant automatically appears. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Topology** to view the topology of the tenant.

This topic shows the distribution of tenant replicas in the cluster. In the upper-right corner of the page, you can resize and refresh the topology.

The topology consists of four layers:

* The first layer indicates the cluster.

* The second layer indicates the tenant arbitration service.

* The third layer indicates the zones.

* The fourth layer indicates the OBServer nodes.
