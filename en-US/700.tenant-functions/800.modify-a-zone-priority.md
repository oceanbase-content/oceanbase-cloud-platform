# Modify zone priorities

This topic describes how to modify zone priorities.

## Precautions

In a **standalone centralized** database, you cannot modify the priority of a zone for a tenant.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** to go to the **Tenants** page.

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the target tenant and click its name to go to its details page.

4. In the **Primary Zone** section, click **Modify**. In the dialog box that appears on the right, you can modify the zone priorities.
