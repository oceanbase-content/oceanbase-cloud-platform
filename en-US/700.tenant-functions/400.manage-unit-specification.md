You can create, modify, and delete unit specifications on the page that appears after you click Unit Specification Management in the upper-right corner of the Tenants page in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

## Prerequisites

The logged-on user in the OCP console has the **update** permission on the target tenant.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** tab automatically appears.

3. Click the **Unit Specifications** tab to view the unit specification list.

   In the **Units**list, you can view information about all units in the following columns: **Type Name**, **CPU Cores**, **Memory (GiB)**, **Log Disk (GiB)**, **IOPS**, **Unit Types**, and **Actions**.

   * You can sort unit specifications by **CPU Cores**, **Memory (GiB)**, **Log Disk (GiB)**, or **IOPS**.

   * You can also filter unit specifications by type, which can be **Default** or **Custom**.

   * In the **Actions** column, you can click **Edit** or **Delete** to manage unit specifications.

   | CPU | The number of CPU cores for the unit specification. The minimum value is 0.5. You must enter an integral multiple of 0.5. <br>If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, you can enable **Advanced CPU Settings** and configure CPU overprovisioning. Specifically, you can configure the minimum and maximum numbers of CPU cores for the unit specification. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>If the cluster version is OceanBase Database V4.0 or later, you must select at least 1 CPU core. </p></main> |
   | Memory | The memory for the unit specification, in GiB. The minimum value is 1 GiB. You must enter an integer.  |
