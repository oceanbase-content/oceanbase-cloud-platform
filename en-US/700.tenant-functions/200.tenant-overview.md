# View tenant overview information

A tenant is a logical concept that represents a resource allocation unit in ApsaraDB for OceanBase. It is the basis for the management of database objects and resources. It is critical for system O&M, especially for the O&M of cloud databases.

After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, you can click **Tenants** in the left-side navigation pane to go to the **Tenants** page, where you can obtain the tenant overview information. By default, the page displays a list of tenants that you have the permission to view, and displays the performance monitoring charts of the top 5 tenants. You can also perform tenant management operations on this page. For more information, see [Manage unit specifications](../700.tenant-functions/400.manage-unit-specification.md), [Create a tenant](../500.quickstart/600.quickstart-create-a-tenant.md), [Lock a tenant](600.manage-a-tenant/300.locked-a-tenant.md), and [Copy a tenant](600.manage-a-tenant/200.replication-a-tenant.md).

## Tenants

On the **Tenants** page, you can view tenant information in the following columns: **Tenant Name, Tag, Cluster, OceanBase version number, Mode, Primary Zone, Read-only, Locked, Status, and Created On**. The **Actions** column provides options for you to perform related operations on tenants. You can query tenants by name in batches, and the tenant names are separated with spaces.

* You can click the name of a tenant to go to its **Overview** page. For more information, see [Overview](600.manage-a-tenant/100.overview-of-the-tenant-details-page.md).

* You can hover the pointer over the tag indicating the primary/standby status of a tenant and view its primary tenant or standby tenants in the pop-up window. You can click **Topology of Primary/Standby Tenants** to go to the topology page and view details about the primary tenant or standby tenants of the current tenant. For more information, see [View the topology of primary/standby relationships of a tenant](900.manage-tenant-topulogy/200.view-primary-standby-tenants-topology.md).

* You can hover the pointer over the tag of a tenant to view all its tags. You can click the **Edit** icon to manage the tags. For more information, see [Manage tags](../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-tags/100.tags-overview.md).

* You can click the **Copy** icon next to the name of a tenant to copy its name.

* You can sort tenants by the **Cluster** column. In addition, you can click the name of a cluster to go to the tenant management page of the cluster. For more information, see [Overview of the Cluster Details page](../600.cluster-functions/300.manage-a-cluster/200.overview-of-the-cluster-details-page.md).

* When a tenant is in the **Maintaining** state, you can click **View Task** in the **Actions** column to go to the task details page of the tenant. On the task details page, you can perform operations such as viewing task logs, rolling back a task, and retrying a task. For more information, see [Manage tasks](../1600.system-management-features/600.manage-tasks.md).
