# View tenant overview

A tenant is a logical concept that represents a resource allocation unit in OceanBase Database. It is the basis for the management of database objects and resources. It is critical for system O\&M, especially for the O\&M of cloud databases. After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, click Tenants in the left-side navigation pane. The Tenant Overview page appears. By default, the page displays a list of tenants that you have the permission to view, and displays performance monitoring charts of top 5 tenants.

On the **Tenants** page, you can see a **Tenants** list and charts of **Top 5 Tenants** . You can also perform tenant management operations on this page. For more information, see [Unit specification management](../700.tenant-functions/400.manage-unit-specification.md), [Create a tenant](../500.quickstart/600.quickstart-create-a-tenant.md), [Lock a tenant](600.manage-a-tenant/300.locked-a-tenant.md), and [Copy a tenant](600.manage-a-tenant/200.replication-a-tenant.md).

## Tenants

The **Tenants** list contains the following columns: **Name, Cluster, OceanBase version number, Mode, Primary Zone, Read-only, Locked, Status, Created On** , and **Actions** . Batch query of cluster names is supported, and spaces are used between each cluster name.

* You can click the name of a tenant to go to the tenant details page. For more information, see [Tenant overview](600.manage-a-tenant/100.overview-of-the-tenant-details-page.md).

* Supports sorting operations on **the cluster** to which it belongs. Click the cluster name, the Overview page of the cluster appears. For more information, see [Overview of the cluster details page](../600.cluster-functions/300.manage-a-cluster/200.overview-of-the-cluster-details-page.md).
