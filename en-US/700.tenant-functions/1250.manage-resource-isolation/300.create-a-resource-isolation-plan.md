# Create a resource isolation plan

To refine resource management, you can isolate tenant resources by using OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) in a visualized manner. The system allocates resources to corresponding resource groups based on the configured resource isolation plan, thereby simplifying tenant resource management.

## Prerequisites

* Resource isolation depends on the cgroup configuration. Make sure that you have enabled the cgroup feature for the cluster to which the target tenant belongs.
* Only OceanBase Database V4.1 and later support resource isolation plans.

## Procedure

1. Log in to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resource Isolation** to go to the isolation plan page of the tenant.

5. Click **Create Resource Isolation Plan** to go to the **Create Resource Isolation Plan** page.

6. Specify the basic information, including **Plan Name** and **Description**.

    | Parameter | Description |
    |--------|---------|
    | Plan Name | The name of the resource isolation plan. It can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_) and must be 2 to 24 characters in length.       |
    | Description | Optional. Enter the remarks of the resource group. The remarks support any characters and must be within 1,000 characters in length.       |

    Click **Next**.

7. Select a resource group for the resource isolation plan.

    In the **Resource Group Name** section, select an existing resource group from the drop-down list. The system automatically fills in the resource isolation type and matching rules in the lower part. A resource group can be bound to only a single resource isolation plan.

    * If no resource group is created for a tenant, click **Create Resource Group** in the **Resource Group Name** section to create one. For more information, see [Create a resource group](200.create-a-resource-group.md).
    * Click **Add Resource Group** to specify multiple resource groups for the current resource isolation plan.
    * Click the **Delete** icon in the upper-right corner of the card for a resource group to remove it from the current resource isolation plan.

    Click **Next**.

8. Configure resource isolation limitations for each specified resource group.

    | Parameter | Description |
    |--------|---------|
    | Maximum CPU | Optional. UTILIZATION_LIMIT: the maximum CPU resources allowed for the resource group. The default value is `100`. The value range is [0, 100]. The minimum IOPS value cannot exceed the maximum IOPS value. |
    | CPU Weight | Optional. MGMT_P1: the percentage of CPU resources guaranteed for the resource group when the system runs at full load. The default value is `100`. </br>Calculation formula: Current MGMT_P1 value × 100/Sum of MGMT_P1 values of all resource groups in the resource isolation plan      |
    | Minimum IOPS | Optional. MIN_IOPS: the IOPS resources reserved for the resource group in the case of I/O resource contention. The sum of the MIN_IOPS values of all resource groups in the resource isolation plan cannot exceed 100. The default value is `0`. The maximum MIN_IOPS value of the current resource group is affected by other resource groups in the resource isolation plan. <ul><li>If the resource units of the tenant have the same IOPS value, only the IOPS value reserved for the current resource group is displayed. </li><li>If the resource units of the tenant have different IOPS values, the IOPS values reserved in the resource group for different zones are displayed. </li></ul> |
    | Maximum IOPS | Optional. MAX_IOPS: the maximum IOPS resources allowed for the resource group. The sum of the MAX_IOPS values of all resource groups in the resource isolation plan can exceed 100. The default value is `100`.<ul><li>If the resource units of the tenant have the same IOPS value, only the maximum IOPS value of the resource group is displayed. </li><li>If the resource units of the tenant have different IOPS values, the maximum IOPS values of the resource group for different zones are displayed. </li></ul> <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>The maximum IOPS value cannot be smaller than the minimum IOPS value. </p></main> |
    | IOPS Weight | Optional. WEIGHT_IOPS: the IOPS weight, which determines the percentage of additional IOPS resources that can be allocated to the current resource group on the premises that IOPS resources are reserved for all resource groups. The sum of the WEIGHT_IOPS values of all resource groups in the resource isolation plan can exceed 100. The default value is `0`.<br>Calculation formula: Current WEIGHT_IOPS value × 100/Sum of WEIGHT_IOPS values of all resource groups in the current resource isolation plan      |

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The IOPS weight is affected by the configurations of other resource groups in the resource isolation plan and therefore dynamically changes. </p>
    </main>

    Click **Next**.

9. Confirm the configurations.

    Confirm the information of the resource isolation plan and click **OK**.
