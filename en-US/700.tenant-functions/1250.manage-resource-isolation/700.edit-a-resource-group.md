# Modify a resource group

If the resource configurations in a resource group are no longer applicable, you can modify the resource group.

## Prerequisites

* Resource isolation depends on the cgroup configuration. Make sure that you have enabled the cgroup feature for the cluster to which the target tenant belongs.
* You have created a resource group for the tenant.

## Procedure

1. Log in to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resource Isolation** to go to the isolation plan page of the tenant.

5. Click the **Resource Group** tab.

6. Select the target resource group and click **Modify** in the **Actions** column.

    You can modify the **resource isolation type** and resource isolation content of the resource group. For more information, see [Create a resource group](200.create-a-resource-group.md).

7. Click **Submit**.
