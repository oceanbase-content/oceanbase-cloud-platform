# Enable or disable a resource isolation plan

After you create a resource isolation plan for a resource group, you must enable the plan to trigger resource isolation. After you enable the resource isolation plan, resources are allocated in the tenant based on the plan. You can disable the resource isolation plan when you no longer need it.

## Precautions

* You must create a resource isolation plan for the current tenant.
* You can enable only one resource isolation plan for a tenant.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**.

3. In the **Tenants** list, find the target tenant and click its name.

   The **Overview** page of the tenant automatically appears.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resource Isolation**. The **Isolation Plan** tab of the tenant automatically appears.

5. You can enable a resource isolation plan for a tenant in the following ways:

   * Method 1

      If no resource isolation plan is enabled for the tenant, click **Enable Resource Isolation Plan** in the prompt. In the dialog box that appears, select the target plan from the **Resource Isolation Plan** drop-down list and click **OK**.

   * Method 2

      Go to the tab of the plan to be enabled. Click **Enable** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.
