# Delete a resource group

If you no longer need a resource group for resource isolation, you can delete the resource group.

## Prerequisites

* Resource isolation depends on the cgroup configuration. Make sure that you have enabled the cgroup feature for the cluster to which the target tenant belongs.
* You have created a resource group for the tenant.

## Procedure

1. Log in to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Tenants**. The **Tenants** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Tenants** page, find the target tenant and click its name to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

4. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Resource Isolation** to go to the isolation plan page of the tenant.

5. Click the **Resource Group** tab.

6. Select the target resource group and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>After you delete a resource group bound to the resource isolation plan of a tenant, resource usage of the tenant can no longer be limited based on this resource group. </p>
    </main>

7. Click **OK**.
