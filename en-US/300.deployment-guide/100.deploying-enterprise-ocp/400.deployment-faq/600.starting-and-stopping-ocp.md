# Start and stop OCP

By default, OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) is started after it is deployed. This topic describes how to start and stop OCP.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP host as the admin user.

2. Run the `docker ps -a` command to query the OCP container ID.

   ```javascript
   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
   a924a9853ea0        ocp:312                                                                  "/usr/bin/supervisord"   2 weeks ago         Up 6 days                               ocp

   50126e0eec15        8cc2986bf3a0                                                             "/usr/bin/supervisord"   8 months ago        Up 8 months                             distracted_heyrovsky
   1ea473f6c0c3        reg.docker.alibaba-inc.com/oceanbase-platform/grafana:7.0.3              "/run.sh"                8 months ago        Up 8 months                             grafana
   ```

   The CONTAINER ID column shows the container ID. The OCP container ID is a924a9853ea0.

3. Run the following command to start OCP:

   ```javascript
   docker start a924a9853ea0
   ```

4. Run the following command to restart OCP:

   ```javascript
   docker restart a924a9853ea0
   ```

5. Run the following command to stop OCP:

   ```javascript
   docker stop a924a9853ea0
   ```
