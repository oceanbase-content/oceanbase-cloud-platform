# Monitor the OCP service health

When the OCP service experiences abnormality but port listening continues, users may see the OCP-Console logon page but are not able to log on after entering the user name and password. Therefore, OCP service health must be monitored to prevent F5 BIG-IP LTM from sending requests to abnormal OCP nodes.
