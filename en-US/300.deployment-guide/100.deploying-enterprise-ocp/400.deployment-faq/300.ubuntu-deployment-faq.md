# Ubuntu deployment FAQ

1. Q: What shall I do when the system indicates that the version cannot be found when I run ob_admin?

A: Copy the libssl.so.1.0.1e and libcrypto.so.1.0.1e files of the OBServer to

`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` and create symbolic links libssl.so.10 and libcrypto.so.10. Note the path is different between ARM and x86.

2. Q: What shall I do if OceanBase Database fails to start and the log contains a "too many open files" error?

A: This is because the limit on the number of open files is too small. You can run the

`ulimit -n 655360` command on the host to change the limit to a larger value.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>It is possible the ulimit value cannot be changed in the container. Change it on the host instead.</p>
