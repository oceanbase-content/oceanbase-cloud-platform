# Check the environment

This topic describes how to check the resources, ports, software versions, and time of a host.

## Check host resources

Check whether the host resources meet the minimum requirements specified in [Hardware requirements](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/100.ocp-server-specifications-single-node.md).

* Run the following command to check the number of CPU cores:

  ```java
  cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l;
  ```

* Run the following command to check the memory size:

  ```java
  free -g;
  ```

* Run the following command to check whether the operating system of each host meets the requirements specified in Operating system requirements:

  ```java
  uname -a;
  ```

## Check ports

Run the `telnet`, `nc`, or `netstat` command to check whether a listening port is occupied by other processes. For more information, see [Component listening port list](../../../2100.appendix/400.component-listening-port-list.md).

```python
# Run the telnet command to check the port. If the port is occupied, a '>' prompt is displayed. If the port is available, the following message is returned: telnet: connect to address xxx.xxx.xxx.1: Connection refused
telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.1 $PORT

# Run the nc command to check the port. If the port is occupied, 0 is returned. If the port is available, a value other than 0 is returned.
echo hi | nc xxx.xxx.xxx.1 $PORT -w 2 > /dev/null 2>&1
echo $?

# Run the netstat command to check the port.
sudo netstat -anp | grep -w $PORT
```

## Check software versions

Run the package management command in the operating system of each host to check whether the software packages meet the requirements specified in [Software requirements](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/100.deploying-a-single-point-of-ocp/600.initialize-system-parameters-single-point.md).

## Check host time

* If you have configured the `NTP` service, you can run the `ntpstat` command to check the host time.

* If the `NTP` service is unavailable, run the `date` command to check the host time and compare the time difference between hosts.
