# Add a server

Before you deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you must add the server where OCP (including MetaDB and MonitorDB) is to be installed to OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT).

## Prerequisites

* Before you add the server, make sure that you have installed OAT and logged on to it as the super administrator or an O&M engineer. For more information, see [Install OAT](../200.prepare-the-deployment-environment/100.install-oat.md).
* In the scenario of deploying multi-node OCP, you need to add multiple servers.

## Procedure

1. Log on to OAT.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Server > Server Management**.

3. On the **Server Management** page, click **Add Server** in the upper-right corner.

   The following table describes the server fields.

   | Field | Description |

   | Server IP | The public IP address of the server to be added.  |
   | SSH Port | The SSHD port of the server to be added.  |
   | Credentials | The access credentials of the server to be added. At present, two types of credentials are supported: (1) username + password (2) key.  |
   | Initialize configuration | This feature must be enabled to initialize the server configurations.  |
   | Server usage | The purpose of the server to be added.  |

5. Click **OK**.

   After the server is added, it appears in the server list and is in the **Initializing** state. On the **Server Management** page, you can find the added server and click **View tasks** in the **Actions** column of the server record to view the task progress. If the server list contains too many servers, you can search for the server by IP address in the upper part of the page.****

   If a failed subtask does not affect services, you can view the logs and then manually set the subtask to successful.
