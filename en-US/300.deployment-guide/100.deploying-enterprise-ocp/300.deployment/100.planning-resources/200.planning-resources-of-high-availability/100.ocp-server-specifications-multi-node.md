# OCP-Server specifications

OCP-Server consumes a large amount of computing and storage resources. Therefore, you need to plan resources based on the number of targets to be managed. In the multi-node deployment modes, you need to add multiple servers in [Add Server](../../../200.prepare-the-deployment-environment/200.standardized-host.md), and each server needs to meet the following requirements.

## CPU and memory

The following table lists the CPU and memory resource requirement of OCP-Server on the premises that each managed host runs 10 tenants. You can calculate the required CPU and memory resources based on your business requirements.

| **Number of managed hosts** | **CPU (core)** | **Memory (GB)** |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **≤** 10                    | 4              | 8               |
| ≤ 50                        | 8              | 16              |
| ≤ 100                       | 16             | 32              |
| ≤ 200                       | 32             | 64              |
| ≤ 400                       | 64             | 128             |

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>OCP-Server requires a minimum of 4 CPU cores, 8 GB of memory, and 500 GB of available disk space. This configuration still applies when you need to manage only one host that runs less than or equal to 10 tenants.</li>
    <li>OCP-Server can manage more than 400 hosts, but this is not tested in the production environment. To manage more hosts, contact OceanBase customer service.</li>
    </ul>
  </main>

## Disk space

When OCP-Server is running, it writes files to disks, which occupies disk space. We recommend that you reserve at least 500 GB of disk space for OCP-Server to prevent disk space insufficiency from affecting system functionality.

The following table describes the disk usage when OCP-Server is running.

|       **Category** |  **Storage path**  |     **Space requirement**   |
|---------------------------|---|--|
| OCP program               | * /home/admin/ocp-server/   * /home/admin/ocp-init/    | The OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) program occupies about 1 GB of disk space after installation. The RPM packages provided with it require about 5 GB of space. Therefore, we recommend that you reserve 10 GB of space. |
| OCP main process log      | /home/admin/logs/ocp/     | The log file size and the number of retained files are configured through OCP system parameters.  By default, each log file is 100 MB large and retained for up to 100 days, and at least five files are generated each day. Therefore, we recommend that you reserve 100 GB of space.        |
| OCP task log              | /home/admin/logs/task/    | No capacity limit is set. OCP periodically clears task logs to meet the target of keeping more than 20% of disk space free. Log files updated at earlier dates are cleared first. 100 GB of space needs to be reserved.    |
| Local cache for OCP files | /home/admin/data/files/  | No capacity limit is set. Most of the OCP files are installation packages related to targets under OCP management, and they are mostly OceanBase Database installation packages. The average size of each installation package is about 500 MB. Assume that 100 installation packages are stored. 100 GB of space needs to be reserved. |

    <p>The log retention size of OCP-Server can be configured by using OCP system parameters. For more information, see <a href="../../../../../1600.system-management-features/300.manage-system-parameter/200.modify-system-parameters.md">Modify system parameters</a>.</p>
