# Deploy OCP cluster in the Single-node

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) supports two deployment modes: single-node deployment and high-availability deployment. This topic describes how to deploy OCP on a single node.

## Overview

In single-node deployment, all OCP components are deployed on a single node. This node provides all OCP capabilities. The OCP components include OCP-Server, MetaDB, MonitorDB, and OBProxy.

This deployment mode has the following benefits:

* All services are deployed on one host, which minimizes the required resources.

* All requests are handled on one host without distributed processing, which facilitates log lookup and debugging.

* OCP depends on fewer services and does not require server load balancing.

    <p>Single-node deployment applies to scenarios with low availability and fast verification requirements. </p>

### Deployment process

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) on a single node.

The deployment process is divided into four steps: planning resources, preparing the deployment environment, deploying OCP on a single node, and check after deployment, as shown in the following figure.

| Sequence |  Step  |   Description  |
|----------|------|------|
| 1        | Plan resources  | For more information, see [OCP-Server specifications](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/100.ocp-server-specifications-single-node.md), [MetaDB resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/200.metadb-resources-single-node.md), [MonitorDB resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/300.monitordb-resources-single-node.md), and [Host resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/400.prepare-host-single-node.md).  |
| 2        | Prepare the deployment environment  | The deployment environment requirements cover the installation media, host resources, and system requirements. For more information, see[Install OAT](../200.prepare-the-deployment-environment/100.install-oat.md), [Add a server](../200.prepare-the-deployment-environment/200.standardized-host.md) and [Host resources](../200.prepare-the-deployment-environment/300.environment-check.md).                                                   |
| 3  | Deploy OCP    | For more information, see [Prepare installation media](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/100.deploying-a-single-point-of-ocp/100.prepare-installation-media-single-point.md), [Deploy metadb](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/100.deploying-a-single-point-of-ocp/200.install-metadb-single-point.md), [Deploy a OCP cluster in the Single-node](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/200.planning-resources-of-high-availability/300.monitordb-resources-multi-node.md), and [Initialize system parameters](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/100.deploying-a-single-point-of-ocp/600.initialize-system-parameters-single-point.md). |
| 4        | [Check after deployment](../300.deployment/300.post-deployment-check.md) | After you deploy OCP, you can verify the installation by checking the OCP features, log files, OCP version, time, and Docker container.   |
