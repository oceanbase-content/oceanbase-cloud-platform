# Deploy OCP cluster in the High-availability

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) supports three deployment modes: Multi-node deployment, multi-cluster mode and multi-zone mode.

## Deploy OCP cluster in the multiple nodes

In multi-node deployment, OCP is deployed on multiple nodes, each of which is deployed with all OCP components. The OCP components include OCP-Server, MetaDB, MonitorDB, and OBProxy. For more information about the deployment on each node, see the description of single-node deployment.

All OCP-Server nodes form a stateless service cluster. All MetaDB and MonitorDB nodes form a multi-replica cluster. OBProxies deployed on all nodes also form a stateless service cluster.

In multi-node deployment mode, when a minority of hosts or services on a minority of hosts are unavailable, the entire system is still available.

### Deployment process

The procedure for deploying OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) on multiple nodes is similar to that for deploying OCP on a single node. The only difference is that you need to add multiple servers in the **Add a server step**.

| Sequence |Step|Description  |
|----------|-------|------|
| 1        | Plan resources  | For more information, see [OCP-Server specifications](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/100.ocp-server-specifications-single-node.md), [MetaDB resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/200.metadb-resources-single-node.md), [MonitorDB resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/300.monitordb-resources-single-node.md), and [Host resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/400.prepare-host-single-node.md).  |

## Deploy OCP clusters in the multi-cluster mode

In multi-cluster mode, you can deploy multiple OCP clusters across regions to manage primary and standby OceanBase clusters across regions. You can manage primary and standby OceanBase clusters across OCP clusters. For example, you can create, delete, and update primary and standby OceanBase clusters, and perform switchover and failover. This mode implements a high-availability redundancy architecture based on two IDCs.

High-availability deployment can provide disaster recovery across IDCs and regions. When services in one of the IDCs or regions are unavailable, the entire system is still available.

### Deployment process

The deployment process contains five steps: planning resources, preparing the environment, deploying a leader OCP cluster, deploying follower OCP clusters, and check after deployment, as described in the following table.

| SN |Step | Description |
|----|---|---|
| 1  | Plan resources     | For more information, see [Configure the OCP server](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/100.ocp-server-specifications-single-node.md), [MetaDB resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/200.metadb-resources-single-node.md), [MonitorDB resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/100.planning-resources-of-single-node/300.monitordb-resources-single-node.md) and [Host resources](../300.deployment/100.planning-resources/200.planning-resources-of-high-availability/400.prepare-host-multi-node.md). |
| 2  | Prepare environment   | For more information, see [Install OAT](../200.prepare-the-deployment-environment/100.install-oat.md), [Add a server](../200.prepare-the-deployment-environment/200.standardized-host.md), and [Check the environment](../200.prepare-the-deployment-environment/300.environment-check.md).  |
| 3  | Deploy a leader OCP cluster     | For more information, see [Prepare installation media](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/100.prepare-installation-media-high-availability.md), [Create MetaDB](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/200.install-metadb-high-availability.md), [Deploy OCP](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/300.install-ocp-high-availability.md) and [Initialize system parameters](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/600.initialize-system-parameters-high-availability.md). <blockquote>**Notice**</br>When installing OCP, you need to open the **Multi-cluster mode** and select the cluster type as the **Primary cluster**.</blockquote> |
| 4  | Deploy follower OCP clusters   | For more information, see [Prepare installation media](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/100.prepare-installation-media-high-availability.md), [Create MetaDB](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/200.install-metadb-high-availability.md), [Deploy OCP](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/300.install-ocp-high-availability.md), [Register an OCP cluster](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/500.register-an-ocp-cluster-high-availability.md), and [Initialize system parameters](../300.deployment/200.deploying-ocp/200.deploying-a-high-availability-of-ocp/600.initialize-system-parameters-high-availability.md).  You can deploy multiple follower OCP clusters in the same way.  <blockquote>**Notice**</br>When installing OCP, you need to open the **Multi-cluster mode** and select the cluster type as the **Primary cluster**. If you plan to have multiple standby clusters, you can repeat this step to deploy multiple standby OCPs.</blockquote> |
| 5  | Check after deployment | After the deployment is completed, you can:</br> 1. Check the OCP features, log files, OCP version, time, and Docker container to verify whether the leader and follower OCP clusters are properly deployed. For more information, see [Check after deployment](../300.deployment/300.post-deployment-check.md)  </br> 2. If multi-cluster mode is enabled, log on to the OCP console. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management \> OCP Multi-cluster Mode** . On the page that appears, click the Leader \& Follower Details tab and check the status of the leader and follower OCP clusters to verify whether the follower is bound to the leader.    |

## Deploy OCP cluster in the Multi-zone mode

In multi-zone mode, each zone can be mapped to one or more IDCs. You can allocate an OCP cluster to each of the busy zones or every zone. Each OCP node manages OceanBase cluster replicas in its zone and provides a separate access URL. However, the content that you can view and manage in OCP is the same for all zones.

### Deployment process

The deployment process contains four steps: planning resources, preparing the environment, deploying a OCP cluster in the Multi-zone mode, and check after deployment, as described in the following table.
