# Deploy OCP on the GUI

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition on the GUI of OceanBase Deployer (OBD).

As an essential part of OCP, MetaDB stores metadata and monitoring data that is managed by OCP. OCP-Server manages an OceanBase cluster over its entire lifecycle by calling the data stored in MetaDB. You can use any of the following methods to deploy OCP:

* (Recommended) Create an OceanBase cluster and use it as MetaDB of OCP.

* Use an existing OceanBase cluster as MetaDB of OCP.

## Prerequisites

* You can deploy only OCP Community Edition V4.0.3 or later.

* You have installed and configured a Java environment on by using JDK 1.8, and the build version is at least 161.

* You have obtained the `ocp-all-in-one-4.2.2-YYYYMMDDhhmmss.el7.x86_64.tar.gz` software package and uploaded the package to a directory on the OCP host and run the following command to decompress the package. For more information, see [Prepare for the installation](400.installation-preparation.md).

   ```bash
   tar zxf ocp-all-in-one-4.2.2-YYYYMMDDhhmmss.el7.x86_64.tar.gz
   ```

## (Recommended) Create an OceanBase cluster and use it as MetaDB of OCP

### Step 1: Start OBD

1. Log on to the OCP host.

2. Run the following command to go to the `bin` directory of the decompressed software package, and start the installer:

   ```bash
   cd ocp-all-in-one/bin && sh install.sh
   ```

3. Run the following command to make the environment variables take effect:

   ```bash
   source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
   ```

4. Run the `obd web install` command, and copy the IP address of the deployment wizard page in the response.

   ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/ocp/421-ce/install.png)

### Step 2: Go to the OCP deployment wizard page

1. Open a browser, visit the IP address copied in **Step 1**, and click **Try Now** on the page that appears.

2. Select **OCP** and click **OK**.

3. Select **Create a new OceanBase database MetaDB as OCP** and click **OK**.

### Step 3: Specify the deployment information

1. Specify the name of the OceanBase cluster to be managed.

   The cluster name must be unique. It must start with a letter and end with a letter or digit, and must be 2 to 32 characters in length.

2. Select the versions of services to be deployed.

   The supported version of OBProxy depends on that of OceanBase Database. For example, if you deploy OceanBase Database V4.1.0 or later, you can deploy only OBProxy V4.1.0 or later.

### Step 4: Set parameters of MetaDB

After you create local MetaDB, OCP-Server uses it with higher service reliability.

1. Set parameters of the deployment user.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>To avoid conflicts between OS users, we recommend that you create dedicated OS users for MetaDB and OCP. </p>
    </main>

   | Parameter | Note |
   |---------|----------|
   | Username | The username of the user of the host OS, who has permissions to run sudo commands. The installer requires this username to automatically configure settings.  |
   | Password | The password of the user. If you have enabled password-free logon for the host, skip this parameter.  |
   | SSH Port | The SSH port number of the host. Default value: `22`. You can specify a custom port number.  |
   | Use the running user | If you select this parameter, you can specify a dedicated OS user for OCP. This parameter is optional.  |

   | OBServer Node | Select the OBServer node where you want to deploy MetaDB. You can select multiple OBServer nodes.  |
   | RootServer Node | You can select an IP address as the host for RootService. In an OceanBase cluster that has multiple replicas, you must specify a RootServer node for each zone.  |

   By default, only one zone is added. You can click **Add** to add more zones. To delete a zone, click the Delete icon after the zone to be deleted.

   | Service Port | The listening port of OCP. Default value: `8080`. You can specify a custom port number ranging from 1024 to 65535. Make sure that the specified port is not occupied.  |

2. Allocate resources.

   OCP consumes large amounts of computing and storage resources to provide services. You can allocate resources based on the number of hosts to be managed. In addition, you must set parameters in the **MetaDB Tenant** and **MonitorDB Tenant** sections. This way, the system automatically creates a MetaDB tenant and a MonitorDB tenant to manage the OceanBase cluster over its entire lifecycle.

   1. Specify the number of hosts to be managed.

      The default value is 10. You can change the value as needed.

   2. Specify the memory size.

      By default, 16 GiB of memory is allocated. You must allocate memory resources based on the number of hosts managed by OCP. For more information, see [Host planning](300.installation-planning/200.host-planning.md).

   3. Set parameters of the MetaDB tenant.

      | Parameter | Description |

### Step 6: Perform an environment precheck

Before you start the precheck, you must verify the configuration information.

* If you find an error, click **Previous** to fix it.

* After you verify the information, click **Pre-check**. Then, the system checks whether your environment meets all the requirements for MetaDB and OCP installation and configuration.

  * If the precheck reports an error, you can fix the error based on the solution provided by OCP. If the error can be automatically fixed, you can click **Auto repair** to fix it.

      After all errors are fixed, click **Re-check** to perform a precheck again.

  * If the precheck is passed, click **Next**.

### Step 7: Deploy OCP

You can view detailed installation logs in the **Deployment Logs** section during the OCP deployment process.

* If the deployment fails, check the logs to identify the causes, and contact OceanBase Technical Support. After you identify the causes and fix the issue, click **Redeploy**. Then, the system clears the failed OCP installation environment and re-executes the installer.

* If the deployment succeeds, click **Complete** to exit. Before you exit the installer, you can copy the URL, account username, and account password for logging on to the OCP console.

## Use an existing OceanBase cluster as MetaDB of OCP

If you have deployed an OceanBase cluster, you can perform the following steps to use it as MetaDB of OCP.

### Step 1: Start OBD

1. Log on to the OCP host.

2. Run the following command to go to the `bin` directory of the decompressed software package, and start the installer:

   ```bash
   cd ocp-all-in-one/bin && sh install.sh
   ```

3. Run the following command to make the environment variables take effect:

   ```bash
   source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
   ```

4. Run the `obd web install` command, and copy the IP address of the deployment wizard page in the response.
