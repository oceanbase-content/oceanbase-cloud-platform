# FAQ about deployment

**Q1: How do I view deployment logs?**

A: If you deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) by using OceanBase Deployer (OBD), the deployment logs are displayed on the GUI during the deployment process. For more information, see **Step 7** in [Deploy OCP on the GUI](../500.deploy-ocp.md).

You can also view the deployment logs in the app.log file of OBD, which is stored in the `~/.obd/` directory.

**Q2: It is not easy to spot errors based on deployment logs displayed on the GUI. How do I view more error details?**

A: By default, the deployment logs displayed on the GUI do not contain logs at the DEBUG or TRACE level. You can view more details in the log file stored in the `~/.obd/log/obd` directory.

**Q3: How do I view the logs of OCP?**

A: It depends on the deployment method you used.

* If you deployed OCP by using a Docker container, you need to log on to the container to view the logs.

   ```bash
   # log into ocp container
   docker exec -it ocp bash
   less /home/admin/ocp-server/log/ocp.log
   ```

* If you deployed OCP by using OBD, the log file is stored in the `{ocp_home_path}/log/` directory.

   ```bash
   less ${ocp_home_path}/log/ocp-server.log
   ```
