# Uninstall OCP

This topic introduces how to uninstall OCP. The uninstall steps may vary depending on the version of OCP.

## Procedure

Log in to the OCP host and run the following command in any directory:

```bash
# Uninstall OCP
obd cluster destroy <deploy name>
```

where the `deploy name` parameter must be set the same as the OceanBase cluster name that you specified in **Step 3: Specify the deployment information** in the **(Recommended) Create an OceanBase cluster and use it as MetaDB of OCP** section in the **Deploy OCP on the GUI** topic. Before you uninstall OCP, make sure that the MetaDB cluster used by the OCP deployment is not used by other services.

## Verify the uninstall operation

You can verify the following information to check whether OCP has been uninstalled:

1. Run the `ps -ef | grep ocp-server` command to make sure that the ocp-server process no longer exists on the host of the MetaDB cluster.

   If the ocp-server process no longer exists, the command output should be like this:

2. Ensure that the OCP installation directory has been cleared.
