# Uninstall OCP

This topic describes how to uninstall OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP host as the root user and go to the directory where the `ocp_installer.sh` file is located.

2. Run the following command to uninstall OCP Community Edition:

   ```Java
    # Authenticate with a password
    ./ocp_installer.sh uninstall -c config.yaml -i ./ocp-installer.tar.gz
    # Authenticate using a key file
    ./ocp_installer.sh uninstall -c config.yaml -k /root/.ssh/id_rsa -i ./ocp-installer.tar.gz
    ```

## Check after uninstall

1. Check whether the OCP container on the OCP host has been cleaned up.
2. Check if the MetaDB cluster cleaning is configured synchronously.
    * If the configuration file is configured to clean up the MetaDB cluster, you need to confirm that the OBServer and OBProxy processes on the host of the MetaDB cluster no longer exist, and make sure that the directory has been cleared.
    * If the configuration file is not configured to clean up the MetaDB cluster, you only need to make sure that the databases of MetaDB and MonitorDB have been dropped.
