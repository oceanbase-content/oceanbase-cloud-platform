# Overview

The Community Edition of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) caters to small and medium enterprises with OceanBase management needs, offering basic capabilities such as host management, as well as operation and maintenance of OceanBase clusters and tenants.

Born with OceanBase Database, OCP is an enterprise-level database management platform centered around OceanBase. The latest version of OCP not only fully supports mainstream versions of OceanBase Database from V1.4 to V4.x, but also provides common features such as host management, OceanBase cluster and tenant operation and maintenance, backup and restore. Additionally, it offers refined monitoring and alerting capabilities.

OCP Community Edition, targeting users with small and medium-sized workloads, has been streamlined to ensure that the users can independently deploy and use it with limited resources. We have preserved essential features to meet their basic requirements for OceanBase cluster and tenant operation and maintenance.
