# Post-deployment check

After completing the deployment, you can verify the success of the deployment by checking OCP login, OCP features, log files, OCP version, and clock time.

## Check OCP login

1. Enter the access address of the OCP in your browser and press Enter.

   ```bash
   http://<hostip>:<port>/login
   ```

2. On the displayed login page, enter the OCP username and password.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>You can copy the OCP username and password from the page of successful upgrade. To ensure the security of your account, it is recommended that you change the default password after logging in for the first time. For instructions on how to change the password, see <a href="../../1600.system-management-features/600.management-user-center/200.change-the-logon-password.md">Change your login password</a>. </p>
    </main>

## Check OCP features

Check whether the following features work normally:

* Configure an alert channel to verify that it is available. For instructions on how to configure an alert channel, see [Create an alert channel](../../900.monitoring-and-alerts-functions/200.alert-management/500.manage-alert-channels/100.create-an-alert-channel.md).

* Check basic features such as [adding hosts](../../500.quickstart/400.quickstart-add-a-host.md), [creating clusters](../../500.quickstart/500.quickstart-create-a-cluster.md), [creating tenants](../../500.quickstart/600.quickstart-create-a-tenant.md), and [viewing monitoring metrics](../../900.monitoring-and-alerts-functions/100.performance-monitoring-overview/100.ocp-monitoring-overview.md).

## Check log files

* Check if the `ocp.log` file exists in the `/home/admin/logs/ocp` directory.

* Check if the output information of the `ocp.log` file is normal.

## Check the OCP version

Verify the OCP-Server version information using the following command. If the `buildVersion` in the returned information matches the OCP-Server version, it indicates that the OCP-Server version is correct.

```bash
curl --user <username>:<password> 'http://<OCP_HOST>:<OCP_PORT>/api/v2/info'
```

where

* username: indicates the login account for OCP.

* password: indicates the login password for OCP.

## Check the clock time

You can use the following command to obtain the OCP-Server time. If the returned time matches the expected time, it indicates that the current clock of OCP-Server is normal.

```bash
curl 'http://<OCP_HOST>:<OCP_PORT>/api/v2/time'
```
