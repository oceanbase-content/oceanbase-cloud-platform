# User planning

For users who want to deploy the Community Edition of OCP using the graphical interface, they must have the privileges to run sudo commands without using a password.

You can follow the steps below to manually create a user (using **admin** as an example) and grant sudo privileges to the user:

1. Run the following command to create the **admin** user:

   ```shell
   useradd -U admin -d /home/admin -s /bin/bash
   mkdir -p /home/admin
   sudo chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

2. Run the following command to set a password for **admin**:

   ```shell
   passwd admin
   ```

3. Grant sudo privileges to the user.

   Run the following command to open the `sudoers` file in the `/etc/`directory. Add the following content to the end of the file:

   ```shell
   ## Same thing without a password
   # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   admin       ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

4. Run the following command in the `/home` directory to check the directory privileges:

   ```shell
   ls -ld /data
   ls -ld /home/admin
   ```

   The command output should be like this:

   ```shell
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 2 月 9 18:43
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 2 月 9 18:43 /data
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 2 月 9 18:43 /home/admin
   ```

   If the **admin** user does not have the privileges, run the following command as the root user:

   ```shell
   chown -R admin:admin /data
   chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

   Here, `/data` and `/home/admin` are sample mount directories. Replace the actual mount directories in this section.
