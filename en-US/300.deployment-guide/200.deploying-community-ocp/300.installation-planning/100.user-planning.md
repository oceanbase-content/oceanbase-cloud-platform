# User planning

To deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Community Edition, you must have the permission to run `sudo` commands without using a password.

You can perform the following steps to create a user, for example, `admin`, and grant the `sudo` permission to the user.

   1. Run the following command to create the `admin` user:

      ```shell
      useradd -U admin -d /home/admin -s /bin/bash
      mkdir -p /home/admin
      sudo chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
      ```

   2. Run the following command to set a password for the `admin` user:

      ```shell
      passwd admin
      ```

   3. Configure the sudo permission for the `admin` user.

      Run the following command to open the `/etc/sudoers` file and append the following content to the end of the file:

      ```shell
      ## Same thing without a password
      # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
      admin       ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
      ```

   4. Run the following command to check whether the `admin` user is granted the permission to access related directories: 

      ```shell
      ls -ld /data
      ls -ld /home/admin
      ```

      The following result is returned:

      ```shell
      drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 February 9 18:43
      drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 February 9 18:43 /data
      drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 February 9 18:43 /home/admin
      ```

      If the `admin` user does not have the access permission, run the following commands as the `root` user:

      ```shell
      chown -R admin:admin /data
      chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
       ```

      Note that you need to specify your actual mount directories. The `/data` and `/home/admin` directories in the preceding commands are only examples for your reference.
