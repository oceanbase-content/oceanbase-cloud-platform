## Restart OCP by restarting the OCP container

### Application scenario

The OCP container runs properly but a restart is required for the parameter modifications to take effect.

### Procedure

Run the following command to restart the OCP container:

```shell
docker restart ${ocp_container_name} # Generally, the OCP container is named ocp.
```

## Restart OCP by replacing the OCP container

### Application scenario

The OCP container cannot be properly started and a new container must be created. To restart OCP by using this method, make sure that the deployment files, such as `config.yaml`, `ocp-installer.tar.gz`, and `ocp.tar.gz`, exist on the OCP server and that the configurations in the `config.yaml` file match the current environment.

### Procedure

Run the following commands to replace the OCP container:

```shell
cd ${installer_path}
./ocp_installer.sh replace -c config.yaml -i ocp-installer.tar.gz -o ocp.tar.gz -k ${path_to_key_file}
```
