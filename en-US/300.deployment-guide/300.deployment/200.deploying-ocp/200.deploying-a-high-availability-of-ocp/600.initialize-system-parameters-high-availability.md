# Initialize system parameters

This topic describes how to initialize system parameters.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the navigation bar on the left, choose **System Management** \> **System Parameters** .

3. In the parameter list, find the system parameters to be modified, and change their initial values.

    After installing OCP, verify and modify the system parameters listed in the following table.

    | **Parameter** | **Description**  |      **Initial value**      |
    |------------------------------------------|---|---|
    | **server.port**                          | Application server port number. This setting takes affect after OCP-Server is restarted.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 8080                        |
    | **ocp.site.url**                         | URL for accessing the OCP website. This is also the URL used by hosts managed by OCP to access ocp-server. The URL must begin with HTTP (HTTPS is not supported), must contain the virtual IP address, domain name, or port number, and must not end with a forward slash (/). | `<http://localhost:8080>`       |
    | **ocp.config-uri.site.url**              | URL for accessing the OCP config url service. The default value is empty, indicating that the URL specified for ocp.site.url parameter is used. If the config url service is deployed separately, you must set a value different from ocp.site.url.                            | The default value is empty. |
    | **ocp.system.obproxy.address**           | OBProxy address, which is used by OCP to manage OceanBase clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | localhost                   |
    | **ocp.system.obproxy.port**              | OBProxy port number, which is used by OCP to manage OceanBase clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 2888                        |

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If OCP-Server is installed with the Docker image, OCP-Server includes an OBProxy for managing OceanBase clusters. In this case, you do not need to modify ocp.system.obproxy.address or ocp.system.obproxy.port. If you do not want to use this OBProxy, you can modify these parameters to specify the required OBProxy cluster.</li>
    <li>If OCP-Server is installed with RPM packages, you must install OBProxy for OCP to manage OceanBase clusters, and modify the ocp.system.obproxy.address and ocp.system.obproxy.port parameters.</li>
    </ul>
   </main>

    During MetaDB initialization, the user may use an address that is not load balanced to connect to the OceanBase cluster where MetaDB is located. If that is the case, the automatically generated MonitorDB connection parameters will also employ direct connection for OceanBase. If you want to use a load balancing address (DNS or virtual IP address) to connect to MonitorDB later, modify the following load balancing parameters.

    |   **Parameter**    |          **Description**          |
    |--------------------|-----------------------------------|
    | ocp.monitordb.host | MonitorDB connection address.     |
    | ocp.monitordb.port | MonitorDB connection port number. |

4. Restart OCP-Server after you modify the parameters to make them take effect.
