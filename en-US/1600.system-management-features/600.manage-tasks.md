# Manage tasks

In the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, you can view and manage the following tasks: OCP system management tasks, and tasks that are initiated in the OCP console for the O&M and management of OceanBase clusters, tenants, and hosts.

This topic describes how to view task details and handle failed tasks.

## Prerequisites

You have the ADMIN or TASK_MANAGER role.

## View task details

In the OCP console, the number of **Running** and **Failed** tasks is displayed next to **Task Center** in the upper-right corner of the page. You can view task details by using one of the following methods:

* Method 1: Hover over **Task Center** and click the number of tasks in a specific state in the tooltip. On the **Tasks** page, tasks are filtered by status and only those in the selected state are displayed.

* Method 2: Click **Task Center** and view tasks in all states on the **Tasks** page.

The procedure of **Method 2** is described as follows:

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. Click **Task Center** in the top navigation bar. The **Tasks** page appears.

3. On the **Tasks** page, filter tasks by the task execution status or task initiator. You can also search for tasks by the operation object and task name.

   All tasks that match the criteria will be displayed in the **Tasks** list. You can click the link of an object in the **Object** column to go to the overview page of the object.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>If the object is deleted, you can view only the object name and object type, and cannot go to the overview page of the object. </p>
   </main>

4. Click the name of the task that you want to view to go to its details page. By default, task information is displayed in the log view on the details page. You can switch to the flow view by clicking the button of the view.

   * The log view displays the logs of subtasks. You can switch between subtasks in the left-side area, and view execution information and all logs of a subtask in the right-side area. You can perform operations on a subtask by clicking corresponding buttons in section ① or ②, as shown in the following figure.

   * The flow view shows the sequence of subtasks in a flowchart. You can click the expand icon to display logs in the lower part of the screen, and drag the edge of the log window to the desired size. You can also click the **More** icon on the right of a subtask and select the operation to perform.

      <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>You can drag the pointer in an empty area to move the flowchart, and scroll to zoom it in and out. You can also use the zoom control in the upper-right corner to resize the canvas. The center of zooming is the pointer. For a long task, you can first zoom out, locate the subtask of interest, and then zoom in from there. </p>
      </main>

   The supported operations vary depending on the status of the subtask.

    * For a subtask in the **Completed** state, you can view its detailed logs.

    * For a subtask in the **Failed** state, you can perform the following operations:

       * Download logs of the subtask.

       * Retry the subtask. You can roll back the subtask and then perform it again. If the current subtask is successful, perform subsequent subtasks.

       * Skip the subtask. You can directly set the status of the current subtask to successful and perform subsequent subtasks. Skipping a subtask may result in exceptions. Proceed with caution.

    * For a subtask in the **Running** state, you can download logs of the subtask or terminate it. After you terminate a subtask, the subtask enters the **Aborted** state and the parent task enters the **Failed** state. You can skip or retry a terminated subtask, or download its logs.

    * For a subtask in the **Warning** state, you can perform the following operations:

      * Download logs of the subtask.

      * Retry the subtask. You can roll back the subtask and then perform it again.

    * For a subtask in the **Suspended** state, you can perform the following operations:

      * Download logs of the subtask.

      * Continue with the subtask.

## Retry a failed task

You can retry a task in the **Roll Back Failed** or **Failed** state. To retry a failed task, all failed subtasks of the current task are rolled back and executed again. A subtask is executed only when the execution of the previous subtask succeeds.

You can retry a failed task by using one of the following methods:

* Method 1: On the **Tasks** page, click **Retry** in the **Actions** column of a failed task.
* Method 2: On the task details page, click **Retry** in the upper-right corner.

The procedure of **Method 1** is described as follows.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. Click **Task Center** in the top navigation bar. The **Tasks** page appears.

3. Find the failed task that you want to retry and click **Retry** in section ① in the **Actions** column.

   To retry multiple failed tasks at a time, select the tasks and click the button in section ②.

## Abort a failed task

If a task in the **Roll Back Failed** or **Failed** state cannot be continued, and you have completed all O&M operations included in the task on the CLI, you can abort the task to complete it.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>This operation ignores the failed state of the task and directly terminates it. You can no longer perform any operations on an aborted task. This may result in the loss of metadata or status inaccuracy for OCP. Proceed with caution. </p>
</main>

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. Click **Task Center** in the top navigation bar. The **Tasks** page appears.

3. Find the failed task that you want to abort and click **Abort** in the **Actions** column.

## Locate the task progress

During the execution of a task, you can click **Locate Current Progress** to locate the subtask being executed. This allows you to view the execution status and logs of the task. If you click **Locate Current Progress** for a task in the **Failed** state, you can quickly locate the failed subtask and related execution errors.

On the details page of a task, you can click **Download Logs** in the upper-right corner to download the execution logs of all subtasks of the task to your local host.
