# Enable/Disable an SSO integration task

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows you to enable only one single sign-on (SSO) integration task. If multiple SSO integration tasks are created, you can enable or disable an SSO integration task to change the third-party logon mode.

## Prerequisites

You have the permissions of the ADMIN user.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **External Integration**, and click the **SSO Integration** tab.

3. Find the SSO integration task to be enabled or disabled, and then turn on or off the switch in the **Enable** column.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.
