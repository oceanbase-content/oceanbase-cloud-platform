# Modify objects bound to a tag

This topic describes how to modify the objects bound to a tag. After you attach a tag to a resource object, the tag information is directly applied on the object.

## Prerequisites

* You have been assigned the `ADMIN` role and have the required privileges.
* For the same resource object, a tag key corresponds to a single tag value. If you bind a resource object to a tag with the same tag key as its original tag, the object is automatically unbound from the original tag and bound to the new tag.
* You can bind each resource object to at most 20 tags.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management > Tag Management**.

3. Go to the **Tag Overview** page, select the tag for which you need to modify the bound objects, and click **Change Bound Object** in the **Actions** column of the tag.

4. In the panel that appears, select the object scope.

   * In the first pane, select the type of resource objects to which the tag is bound, which can be **OceanBase Cluster**, **OceanBase Database Tenant**, **OBProxy Cluster**, **Host**, or **Arbitration Service**. If you select only an object type, all resource objects under this type are bound to the tag at a time.
   * In the second pane, select one or more resource objects to which you want to bind the tag.

   For example, you can select only the **Host** type without selecting specific hosts to apply the tag to all hosts, or select specific host IP addresses to apply the tag only to the selected hosts, as shown in the following figure.

5. Click **OK**.
