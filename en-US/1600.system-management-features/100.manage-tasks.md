5. On the task details page in flow view, you can click the **More** icon on the right of a subtask and select an operation. The supported operations vary depending on the status of the subtask. You can also perform this step in the log view.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>

   <h4>Note</h4>

   <p>On the task details page, the <strong></strong>flow view shows the sequence of different subtasks in a flowchart. Drag the pointer in an empty area to move the flowchart. Scroll to zoom in and out. You can also use the zoom control in the upper-right corner to adjust the canvas size. The center of zooming is the pointer. For a long task, you can first zoom out, locate the subtask of interest, and then zoom in from there. </p>

   </main>

   * You can query logs of successful subtasks.

      Expand the menu to display the log information in the lower part of the screen. You can drag edges of a window to expand it.

   * For failed subtasks, you can perform the following operations:

      * View the logs.

      * **Rerun**: Rerun the subtask. The operation will be first rolled back, and then performed again. If the operation is successful, subsequent subtasks are performed.

      * **Change to Successful**: After you set the status of a failed subtask to successful, subsequent subtasks are performed.

   * For subtasks that are running, you can view the logs or terminate them. After you terminate a running subtask, its status becomes failed.

   * You can view logs of pending subtasks.

   * **Roll Back**: Roll back each subtask from the failed subtask all the way back to the first subtask. Task rollback is mainly used for resource recollection and status modification.
