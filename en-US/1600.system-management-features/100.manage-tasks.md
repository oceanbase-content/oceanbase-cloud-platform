# Manage tasks

In the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, you can view and manage the following tasks: OCP system management tasks, and tasks that are initiated in the OCP console for the O&M and management of OceanBase clusters, tenants, and hosts.

This topic describes how to view task details and handle failed tasks.

## Prerequisites

You have the ADMIN or TASK_MANAGER role.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. Click **Task Center** in the top navigation bar.

   All tasks that match the criteria will be displayed in the **Tasks** list. You can click the link of an object in the **Object** column to go to the overview page of the object.

   </main>

4. Click the name of a task to go to its details page.

   By default, the task information is displayed in the form of a log view on the details page. You can click the buttons in section ① to switch between the log view and the flow view, as shown in the following figure.

   The log view displays the logs of subtasks. You can switch between subtasks in the left-side area. On the sample page displayed in the following figure, the `Bootstrap ob` subtask failed. You can view information about the exception and all logs in the left-side area. You can click the buttons in section ② to download logs, retry the subtask, or skip the subtask.

5. On the task details page in the flow view, click the **More** icon on the right of a subtask and select an operation. The supported operations vary depending on the status of the subtask. You can also perform this step in the log view.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>On the task details page, the <strong></strong>flow view shows the sequence of different subtasks in a flowchart. Drag the pointer in an empty area to move the flowchart. Scroll to zoom in and out. You can also use the zoom control in the upper-right corner to adjust the canvas size. The center of zooming is the pointer. For a long task, you can first zoom out, locate the subtask of interest, and then zoom in from there. </p>
   </main>

   * You can query logs of successful subtasks.

      Expand the menu to display the log information in the lower part of the screen. You can drag the edges of a window to expand it.

   * For a failed subtask, you can perform the following operations:

      * View the logs.

      * **Retry**: Rerun the subtask. The subtask will be first rolled back, and then performed again. If the current subtask is successful, subsequent subtasks are performed.

      * **Skip**: Set the status of the subtask to successful and perform subsequent subtasks.

   * For subtasks that are running, you can view the logs or terminate them. After you terminate a running subtask, its status becomes failed.

   * You can view the logs of pending subtasks.

## Retry a failed task

To retry a failed task, all failed subtasks of the current task are rolled back and executed again. A subtask is executed only when the execution of the previous subtask succeeds.

You can retry a failed task by using one of the following methods:

* Method 1: On the **Tasks** page, click **Retry** in the **Actions** column of a failed task.
* Method 2: On the details page of a failed task, click **Retry** in the upper-right corner.

The following procedure demonstrates how to adopt **Method 1**.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. Click **Task Center** in the top navigation bar. The **Tasks** page appears.

3. Find the failed task that you want to retry and click **Retry** in section ① in the **Actions** column.

   To retry multiple failed tasks at a time, select the tasks and click the button in section ②.

## Roll back a failed task

To roll back a failed task, its subtasks are rolled back from the failed subtask all the way back to the first subtask. Task rollback is mainly used for resource recollection and status modification.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. Click **Task Center** in the top navigation bar. The **Tasks** page appears.

3. Click the name of the task that you want to roll back to go to the details page of the task.

4. In the upper-right corner of the task details page, click **Rollback**.
