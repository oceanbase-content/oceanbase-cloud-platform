# Import a credential

This topic describes how to import a credential of an OceanBase cluster. When you take over a cluster, such as an OceanBase cluster, from one OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster to another, you can import the credentials of the cluster and tenants from the original OCP cluster to the new one.

## Prerequisites

You have the privileges of the `HOST_MANAGER`, `CLUSTER_MANAGER`, `TENANT_MANAGER`, or `OBPROXY_MANAGER` role.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Credential Management** to go to the **Credentials** page.

3. Click **Import Credential** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **Import Credential** dialog box, click **Upload** to upload the exported credential file and enter the encryption password specified when you export the credential. For information about how to export a credential, see [Export a credential](200.export-a-credential.md).

5. Click **Next**.

6. Precheck the credential.

   The precheck result shows whether the credential exists and whether the connection test by using the credential succeeds.

7. Select the credential and click **Import**.
