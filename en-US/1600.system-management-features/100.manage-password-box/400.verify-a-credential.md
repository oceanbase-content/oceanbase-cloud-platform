# Verify a credential

This topic describes how to verify whether a credential is available.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Credential Management** to go to the **Credentials** page.

3. On the **OceanBase**, **OBProxy**, or **Host** tab, find the credential to be verified.

4. Click **Verify** in the **Actions** column of the credential.

5. If the verification succeeds, a **Verified** label appears next to the cluster name or credential name. If the verification fails, you need to modify the credential and try again.
