# Users overview

In the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, a user is an operator of system features, and a role is a collection of permissions and is also a carrier of these permissions . A user can perform corresponding operations in the OCP console only when it is assigned one or more roles and have the permissions assigned to the roles. Therefore, the permissions of a user include the permissions of all roles assigned to user.

The initial OCP account admin is a user with the system administrator role and has the permission to manage all clusters and modules in OCP. The system administrator can create other users, and assign one or more roles to each user, to enable the users to carry out corresponding responsibilities in the business architecture. For example, the administrator can create a user with the USER_MANAGER role to create other users on its behalf.

On the User Management tab, you can search for a user, view the username, role, email address, organization, department, and locking status of each user, and perform common O\&M operations.
