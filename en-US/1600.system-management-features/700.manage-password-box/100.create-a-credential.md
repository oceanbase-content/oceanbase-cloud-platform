# Create a credential

This topic describes how to create a credential used by OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) to connect to a cluster or host. You can directly select the created credential when you need to connect to an OceanBase or OBProxy cluster or add a host for a task managed in a new OCP cluster.

## Prerequisites

You have the privileges of the `HOST_MANAGER`, `CLUSTER_MANAGER`, `TENANT_MANAGER`, or `OBPROXY_MANAGER` role.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Credential Management** to go to the **Credentials** page.

3. Click **Create Credential** in the upper-right corner and select the type of the credential.

   Supported types are **OceanBase**, **OBProxy**, and **Host**.

4. In the **Create Credential** dialog box, specify the information about the credential.

   | **Object type** | **Required information** |
   | --- | --- |
   | OceanBase | Specify the OceanBase cluster and tenant to which the connected object belongs, as well as the username and password of the connection user.  |
   | OBProxy | Specify the OBProxy cluster to which the connected object belongs and the username and password of the connection user.  |
   | Host | Specify the information about the credential for connecting to a host.  |

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>A credential of the sys tenant can be used to connect to the sys tenant and the cluster to which the sys tenant belongs. A credential of a tenant other than the sys tenant can be used to connect only to the current tenant. </p>

5. Click **OK**.

   The password box performs a connection test for the credential. If the test fails, the credential creation fails.
