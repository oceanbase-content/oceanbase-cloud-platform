# Batch operations on credentials

This topic describes how to verify, export, and delete credentials in batches.

## Prerequisites

* To perform **batch verification** and **batch export**, you must have the privileges of the `HOST_MANAGER`, `CLUSTER_MANAGER`, `TENANT_MANAGER`, or `OBPROXY_MANAGER` role.
* To perform **batch deletion**, you must be assigned the `ADMIN` role and have the required privileges.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Credential Management** to go to the **Credentials** page.

3. On the **OceanBase**, **OBProxy**, or **Host** tab, select the credentials for batch operation.

4. Click a batch operation type in the upper-right corner of the tab as needed.

   You can click **Batch Verify**, **Batch Export**, or **Batch Delete**.

   * To verify the selected credentials at a time, click **Batch Verify** to test whether the credentials can be used for connection.

   * To export the selected credentials at a time, click **Batch Export**. In the dialog box that appears, enter the encryption password and click **Export**.
